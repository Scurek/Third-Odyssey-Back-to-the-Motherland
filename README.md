# Third Odyssey: Return to the Motherland

[Official code](https://github.com/Scurek/Third-Odyssey-Back-to-the-Motherland) hosted by Scurek.

How to use for local development:
- Clone the Git repo to your "~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod" directory or equivalent.
- Copy the "third_odyssey_DEV.mod" file to that "mod" directory.
  If the directory with the mod Git isn't named "Third-Odyssey-Back-to-the-Motherland", adjust the third_odyssey_DEV.mod file copy.
- Add the mod to your playlist in the EUIV launcher:
  + Press 'Manage Playset' (middle button beneath mods list)
  + Press 'Add more mods' (bottom right)
  + Check 'Third Odyssey DEV' and 'Add 1 mod to playset' (bottom left).
    If 'Third Odyssey DEV' is not visible, check whether the 'path' in the *.mod file and the directory match.
  + Press 'Done' (bottom left)
