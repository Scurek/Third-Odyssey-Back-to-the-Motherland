 to_cultureshock_vbad:0 "Culture Shock -  Revolts"
 desc_to_cultureshock_vbad:0 "The Greek population in this province is in all but open revolt against our Empire, making it impossible to gather tax or recruit from here!"
 to_cultureshock_bad:0 "Culture Shock - Resistance"
 desc_to_cultureshock_bad:0 "The Greek population in this province is treating us as barbarous conquerors, severely affecting our ability to manage them."
 to_cultureshock_medium:0 "Culture Shock -  Shock"
 desc_to_cultureshock_medium:0 "The Greeks in this province treat us like yet another foreign conqueror, moderately hindering our administrative efforts."
 to_cultureshock_light:0 "Culture Shock - Suspicion"
 desc_to_cultureshock_light:0 "The Greek population treats us with suspicion, not quite convinced of our liberator status. This hinders our ability to administrate the region."
 to_cultureshock_vlight:0 "Culture Shock - Confusion"
 desc_to_cultureshock_vlight:0 "While not foreign conquerors, the Greeks in this province do not quite treat us as one of them. This slightly hinders our ability to administrate the region."
 nhs2_shock_events.1.t:0 "Old Home, New Differences"
 nhs2_shock_events.1.d:0 "It has been many decades since we sailed from Constantinople on our Great Odyssey to Elysia. Now that we are back, it is clear that we and the Greeks left behind are no longer entirely the same peoples.\n\n[Root.nhs_2_shock_events_1_desc]"
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_romanorthodox:0 "Fortunately, it seems the differences are negligible, likely owing to our fierce refusal to give up our traditions. Already, our soldiers are ingratiating themselves with the local populace, the language barrier all but non-existent.\n\nUnited by language, religion, and soon, purpose, the Greeks are welcoming us as the long-lost brethren that we are. That being said, there are still differences, many of which are yet to be discovered. Our decisions in dealing with these discoveries will likely decide the fate of the Roman peoples for decades to come."
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.a:0 "Rome is Home"
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_elysianorthodox:0 "Because while the Greeks were left behind to rot under foreign conquerors, we Elysians have forged a new realm, a new culture, far from these once familiar shores.\n\nAlready, the communication difficulties between our legions, particularly the native and norse regiments, are becoming readily apparent. This, along with the Elysian customs we bring from our shores, have made the Greeks wary of us."
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.b:0 "We'll get them up to speed."
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_romanhellenic:0 "Because while we rediscovered the true Gods, our brethren yet cling to our old monotheistic ways. While at first welcoming, with our language not too different from theirs, the revalaiton of our new divine allegiances soon changed their tune for the drastically worse.\n\nNow, we are eyed with suspicion within our own homelands, our soldiers refused lodging without payment or coercion. The rift this has put between us and our Greek Brothers cannot be understated, and how we chose to deal with it will decide the fate of not just our Empire, but our Faith."
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.c:0 "Our Brothers will see the light."
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_elysianhellenic:0 "In fact, we can hardly be recognized as one people any more. We have rediscovered the truth of the Divine, and founded a prosperous culture many miles across the ocean, while the Greeks have been left to rot in their ignorance and occupation.\n\nOur wisdom and enlightenment is seemingly pure anathema to the Greeks, who have greeted us as barbarous invaders, if not demonic interlopers. Already, they are proving as stubborn an enemy as their previous occupiers, and find ourselves fighting the very people we came to liberate.\n\nNeedless to say, something must be done if this invasion is to succeed in anything other than wasting Elysia's resources"
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.d:0 "They better start behaving..."

 to_cultureshock_vlight_tt:0 "Our Greek brethren are welcoming us with open arms, but it will still take a while to get used to our new differences."
 to_cultureshock_light_tt:0 "The Greeks are welcoming us, albeit it with slight waryness. They will be less enthusiastic about signing up for the legions, and paying their taxes."
 to_cultureshock_medium_tt:0 "The Greeks are hesitant in welcoming us back owing to our cultural differences, which will hinder their integration."
 to_cultureshock_bad_tt:0 "Our Greek brethren are outraged at our ways, we should be careful, or risk them openly turning against us."
 to_cultureshock_vbad_tt:0 "The Greeks are outraged at our ways, and have already turned against our liberation armies. The slightest spark will ignite open revolution."
 
 nhs2_shock_events.51.t:0 "Elysian Patriarch Welcomed!"
 nhs2_shock_events.51.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, our Greek subjects have welcomed our deposing of the previous Ecumenical Patriarch with open arms!\n\nYears of Turkish meddling had apparently rotted away the Patriarch's independence and he had become little more than a puppet of the Mohammedans. As such, our replacement has surprisingly become the more impartial and autonomous candidate."
 nhs2_shock_events.51.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
 nhs2_cultureshock_increase.tt:0 "This will drive the Greeks from our fold."
 nhs2_cultureshock_critical.tt:0 "This will push the Greeks past the treshhold!"
 nhs2_cultureshock_decrease.tt:0 "The Greeks will become more open to integration."
 nhs2_cultureshock_solved.tt:0 "This will finally put the Greeks at ease for good!"
 nhs2_shock_events.52.t:0 "Elysian Patriarch Rejected!"
 nhs2_shock_events.52.d:0 "As was expected, the Greeks are not at all happy with our deposing of their Ecumenical Patriarch, and it is being viewed as a heretical infringement on the divine rights of the Patriarch to shepherd his flock.\n\nNeedless to say, this will have negative effects on our standing with our Greek subjects."
 nhs2_shock_events.52.a:0 "Drat..."
