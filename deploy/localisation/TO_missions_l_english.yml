But the Emperor's job is to look beyond the now and to the future of his people, and it is there that he and his Senate have come to a conclusion.\nOur lands lack fresh water. Almost every settlement that grows has built itself around a natural spring, these sites forming precious oasis in what is otherwise a land unusually bereft of the life giving fluid, especially for a place so verdant.\n\nBut already a solution has been proposed. A series of grand aqueducts, equalling those of Old Rome, are to be constructed, connecting our lands to the far mountains that stand only in the distant horizon for the moment. Once constructed these aquatic highways will bring fresh, clean water for use in farming, public baths, sewage systems and more, and we will have conquered yet another obstacle on our road to making our New Elysium be worthy of the name."

No longer are we stranded stragglers trying desperately to cling to life, nor are we utterly lost and unaware of the world beyond our borders or across the sea. Now the world is known to us. And our enemies are known to us. Now is the time to rally the militias and all who would volunteer, and train them into the finest invasion force the world has ever seen. Now is the time to build a war fleet the size of that which bore us to these lands, to take us home and to shatter any wooden wall that tries to get in our way. All Elysians must answer the call of our lost Motherland."

 nhs_border_fortifications_mission_desc:0 "In times long past, we Romans held many fortresses and walled towns, which prevented enemies from attacking our core cities until fhey had breached every one of the outer castles. We must do the same in Elysium - only, it is not enough to merely build walls: we also need cannon and stout men to ensure they stand. The ancient writer Vegetius said it correctly: let him who desires peace prepare for war. We will be prepared."

 nhs_build_army_mission_desc:0 "The Commander of the city guard has received numerous reports of native raids directed at the peasants who work the wheat fields outside the defences of Nea Konstantinoupolis. The obvious solution is to send more men to patrol those areas; however, the guard is spread thin as it is, and this would leave the city severely undermanned. The militia are rather basic right now, made up of retired soldiers and part time farmers, but with a little time and training they could become a significant force in their own right."

Much of the original Roman and European population resides here or along the coast, while the Barbaroi dominate our inland provinces, becoming less 'civilised' further from the capital We must work towards improving the infrastructure and general development of our more inland cities to help spread our influence and create a true homeland for all who come to our shores."

 nhs_diplomacy_mission_desc:0 "We learned the lesson well over the previous centuries: it is better for a foreigner - be he contracted mercenary or allied auxiliary - to die than a Roman soldier. To that end we found it prudent to cultivate strong allies and spend wealth judiciously in order to safeguard our own manpower. This truth has not dissipated in the New World; indeed, we have found it ever more important to court allies and vassals, for we are alone in a sea of rival kingdoms who would not hesitate to hurl us back into the ocean were it not for our skill at making allies out of foes. If we are to rule this Elysium we have found ourselves in, we must not forget that fire and steel only goes so far."

 nhs_elysian_silk_with_secret_desc:0 "A new day dawns on the Romans in the West as we are finally able to resume our silk production in full. No more will we be forced to rely on the inferior 'Skoros' silk, for we have finally been able to produce the vaunted 'sea silk,' on par with the old Chinese production methods we used to have, but lost upon our flight to Elysium. The silk is slightly more difficult to create, but we have a long tradition of silk production and trading, and we should be able to fetch a princely sum for it."

 nhs_elysian_silk_without_secret_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming but now we have finally returned to our ancient Homeland. Europe has long been without its Emperor's of old, but now we return and intend to return it to the Glory it once knew with us at the helm. Already our researchers have scoured the remains of the ancient libraries, what remains after the Turk's occupation is already enough for us to have reawakened the production of our legendary Silks. This is just one small step towards a glorious future with Elysian Dominance proudly woven into the tableaux of time."

 nhs_expanding_north_desc:0 "Throughout our various incarnations, the people of the north have always been both a hindrance and a boon; plundering our shores for wealth and then turning around and pledging to us their 'eternal allegiance'.

 nhs_form_colonial_institution_2_mission_desc:0 "After the Great Storm, the majority of our people had neither the want or need to travel far beyond sight of the coast, preferring to settle farther inland or on nearby islands at most. However, the success of Pytheas' voyage to Europe has shown that is is possible, if difficult, to cross the oceans once again. We must expand our colonial institutions and increase the range at which we can supply new colonies, who knows what riches lie beyond the horizon?"
 nhs_form_colonial_institution_2_mission_title:0 "Colonial Ambitions"
 nhs_form_colonial_institution_mission_desc:0 "We have long struggled to organise the settling of more distant lands. This can change though: we are experienced at seafaring and settling new lands, all we need is a strong national institution to oversee and organise our colonization programs.

 nhs_hegemony_mission_desc:0 "The Elysian Empire - noble descendants and heirs to the Greeks and the Romans - has avoided the cycles of decay and renewal that plagued our forefathers. We have suffered no territorial contraction like in the final centuries of the Roman Empire, and the economy has avoided the complete implosion it underwent in the dying decades of the Western Roman Empire, when the Huns and the Franks and the Goths trampled roughshod over Roman power. Instead the Elysian realm has bounded from strength to strength and has become the greatest in the world, just as we were in the days of Augustus and Trajan. None can match us in our riches or our power, though many lesser kingdoms try.\n\nSome within the realm tell us to always keep improving and to avoid stagnation - but when perfection is reached, what more can one do?"

 nhs_hercules_gates_desc:0 "If we are to maintain our new foothold in Europe, our mighty fleets must remain unhindered as they transfer supplies and troops to and from the new world.

 nhs_industrial_revolution_mission_desc:0 "The rapid industrialisation has led to a unprecedented surplus of wealth.

 nhs_infrastructure_mission_desc:0 "Our Nation is already beginning to rival the sad remnant of an Empire we left behind, but yet currently it lacks in one major respect. Guilds. Within Constantinople there were craftsmen guilds for every art, from blacksmiths and merchants moving the physical world, to priests, alchemists and apothecaries addressing the spiritual and the divine. Guilds are sacred unions of experienced tradesmen, passing on their techniques down to apprentices so that it is not just knowledge but skill that moves on to their successors.\n\nAfter our landing, our new Capitol was constructed out of necessity, with little thought for future planning. Now that the people are thriving beyond the walls, it is the perfect time for a strategy of urban redevelopment, turning New Constantinople and our surrounding heartlands from collections of ramshackle buildings thrown together from whatever was on hand at the time, to urban marvels that Augustus would have been proud to build."
