The first is a direct route from the capital to the mighty Andronika, crossing the Apalesians and following the Helene River west. The second proposal suggests a longer and safer route that would make it more difficult for potential enemies to use our road networks against us. Both routes would certainly facilitate trade and expansion within the region, but there is little sense in pursuing both projects, not to mention a waste of resources.

Though controversial in his own time, history has vindicated him: he founded a dynasty that lasted a hundred years, and Trapezuntine pretenders rose to kingship by sharing his name. He reformed the army, fiscal system, and administration; he, with a silver tongue, convinced the Patriarch of Rome to call the Frankish lands to what would become the First Crusade; he vigorously battled his foes and liberated many walled cities from the empire's enemies in both Europe and Anatolia. It is in his footsteps that we now walk. The path behind us is forever sealed, filled with what-ifs and could-have-beens. The path before us is narrow and treacherous, but the empire can call upon men that are, perhaps, almost the equal of Alexios Komnenos."

Guilds are sacred unions of experienced tradesmen, passing on their techniques down to apprentices so that it is not just knowledge but skill that moves on to their successors.\n\nAfter our landing, our new Capitol was constructed out of necessity, with little thought for future planning. Now that the people are thriving beyond the walls, it is the perfect time for a strategy of urban redevelopment, turning New Constantinople and our surrounding heartlands from collections of ramshackle buildings thrown together from whatever was on hand at the time, to urban marvels that Augustus would have been proud to build."
