But the Emperor's job is to look beyond the now and to the future of his people, and it is there that he and his Senate have come to a conclusion.\nOur lands lack fresh water. Almost every settlement that grows has built itself around a natural spring, these sites forming precious oasis in what is otherwise a land unusually bereft of the life giving fluid, especially for a place so verdant.\n\nBut already a solution has been proposed. A series of grand aqueducts, equalling those of Old Rome, are to be constructed, connecting our lands to the far mountains that stand only in the distant horizon for the moment. Once constructed these aquatic highways will bring fresh, clean water for use in farming, public baths, sewage systems and more, and we will have conquered yet another obstacle on our road to making our New Elysium be worthy of the name."

The obvious solution is to send more men to patrol those areas; however, the guard is spread thin as it is, and this would leave the city severely undermanned.

 to_roman_diplomacy_mission_desc:0 "We learned the lesson well over the previous centuries: it is better for a foreigner - be he contracted mercenary or allied auxiliary - to die than a Roman soldier. To that end we found it prudent to cultivate strong allies and spend wealth judiciously in order to safeguard our own manpower. This truth has not dissipated in the New World; indeed, we have found it ever more important to court allies and vassals, for we are alone in a sea of rival kingdoms who would not hesitate to hurl us back into the ocean were it not for our skill at making allies out of foes. If we are to rule this Elysium we have found ourselves in, we must not forget that fire and steel only goes so far."

No more will we be forced to rely on the inferior 'Skoros' silk, for we have finally been able to produce the vaunted 'sea silk,' on par with the old Chinese production methods we used to have, but lost upon our flight to Elysium.

Within Constantinople there were craftsmen guilds for every art, from blacksmiths and merchants moving the physical world, to priests, alchemists and apothecaries addressing the spiritual and the divine. Guilds are sacred unions of experienced tradesmen, passing on their techniques down to apprentices so that it is not just knowledge but skill that moves on to their successors.\n\nAfter our landing, our new Capitol was constructed out of necessity, with little thought for future planning. Now that the people are thriving beyond the walls, it is the perfect time for a strategy of urban redevelopment, turning New Constantinople and our surrounding heartlands from collections of ramshackle buildings thrown together from whatever was on hand at the time, to urban marvels that Augustus would have been proud to build."
