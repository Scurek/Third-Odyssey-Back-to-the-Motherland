A gifted philosopher and scholar, his contributions had not gone unnoticed by our late Basileus, something which allowed him the opportunity of safe passage to these new strange lands we have come to call home. In his waning years however it has come clear that Pletho holds some controversial if not outright heretical beliefs. Alarmingly he appears to recognise this and has publicly challenged members of our clergy as well as members of the royal family to debate him. While we cannot at the moment afford to expand the energy to rid ourselves of this man nor could we risk losing such a reliable advisor the following years will surely tell us if we were right in letting this heathen board our ships."

The church has made it clear that this is an outrage and if we do not act now it will only embolden the Pagan riff raff. Some have gone as far as to suggest that we should put this down by the sword if need be.

This puts us in a precarious position as intervening in any way may signal that we have taken a side.

Our country is experiencing rapbidly increasing tensions between members of our clergy and other devout Orthodox people on one side, and Pagan disciples on the other. Among the latter, some have taken to the colonies as a means of worshipping in peace. This has stirred fears of heathen enclaves being established in the countryside, an area of lawlessness.

While we should rejoice that these wretched heathens have taken upon themselves to purge our country of their presence, we should also be careful as to not de-populate our colonies and thus reverse our hard-earned progress.

The evidence presented by the Patriarch is staggering and leaves little room for doubt. While an immediate arrest would certainly earn us the favour of our clergy, a fair trial may be more appropriate. When confronted, the advisor flatly denied the evidence while also defending their right to their own belief, accusing our Patriarch of excessive zeal.

Regardless of our own feelings towards the man we are conscious of the tremendous loss. Nonetheless we are confronted yet again by a difficult choice. In light of the circumstance, a state funeral - which should be the obvious choice -  would be controversial.

One one hand allowing a measure of autonomy and protection to the Neo-Pagans would certainly appease them and lessen the risk of an armed revolt.

Sharing his worries and grievances he has proposed a solution which he argues could be mutually beneficial to our country, the church and the $MONARCHTITLE$. He proposed that we establish an inquisition, which would sit above our authorities but would still be subservient to the $MONARCHTITLE$, with the stated objective of ridding all heretics and heathens from our country."
