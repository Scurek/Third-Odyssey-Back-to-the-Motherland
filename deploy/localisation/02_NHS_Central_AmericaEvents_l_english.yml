 msg_arrival_events.1.t:0 "The Expedition of Belisarios [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]"
 msg_arrival_events.1.d:0 "Belisarios [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is a young noble of the Imperial House, and has been known in the palace for being a masterful fencer and an avid student of ancient Hellas. He has gained some influence in court recently, most notably in the selective recruitment from the army to create a rather large personal retinue. Although ordinarily this may have been a threat, his relatively minor status in court has kept the retinue from growing too large. \n\n Now however, Belisarios has made his intentions clear. He has come to the council of [Root.Monarch.GetName] for support in an expedition to lands beyond the Kyklades. He has apparently heard rumours from the Barbaroi that far to the south lie cities made from gold, ruled by vengeful gods. Although it is never directly said, it is clear that he intends to leave whether or not he is supported."
 msg_arrival_events.1.a:0 "\"Very well, you will get your support.\""
 nhs2_msg_supplies:0 "Belisarios will receive additional supplies, and consider himself to be in your debt."
 nhs2_msg_delay:0 "He will petition again next year, and he won't take no for an answer."
 msg_arrival_events.1.b:0 "\"Go, with my blessing.\""
 msg_arrival_events.1.c:0 "\"Please be patient, now is not a good time.\""

 msg_arrival_events.2.t:0 "New Sparta"
 msg_arrival_events.2.d:0 "Your kinsman Belisarios has arrived with his army in what he calls Lakonya. He has already shown himself a capable commander, seizing the coast and establishing "New Sparta" after the ancient city of legend. Having re-named himself Leonidas, he seeks to mimic that hero to conquer the Barbaroi there against all odds."
 msg_arrival_events.2.a:0 "May the Gods be with him"
 msg_arrival_events.2.b:0 "May God be with him"
 msg_arrival_events.2.c:0 "§RI'm going with him myself!§!"
 msg_arrival_events.4.t:0 "Rise of Sparta"
 msg_arrival_events.4.d:0 "After travelling by boat for weeks from Elysia, you, 300 personal guards, numerous volunteers, and their families have founded a stronghold a few miles inland from the coast. Surrounded by thick jungle, the likes of which none of you have ever seen before, and fending off attacks from hostile natives, you call a meeting. \"Today we found the city of New Sparta, and in honour of our Hellenic ancestry, form the nation of Spartakon!\" Whether your brother gave you supplies or not, you send a message to him announcing your intention to lead your men against these natives, outnumbered ten to one, as Leonidas once did."
 msg_arrival_events.4.a:0 "This is Sparta!"
 msg_arrival_events.11.t:0 "Spartans no longer?"
 msg_arrival_events.11.d:0 "We have conquered many of the local people, and their influence can now be seen in almost all levels of our society. At the top of our social order are the \"Apogonoi\" or descendants of the original Spartan warriors, the elite of the elite. They are very few in number but are powerful statesmen and generals regardless. The native nobles that reside in and around the capital make up the largest portion of our noble class, and now call themselves \"Pipiltin\", occupying some of the top positions in the military, priesthood and government. Just below the nobles in our society are the \"Pochteca\", or merchants, who generally live along the coast and go on naval expeditions to trade with other nations. Because of this, they are also used as spies. At the bottom of our society are the \"Tlacotin\" slaves, who are usually taken in war. They are not sacrificed as the natives are known to do, but are used as servants and labourers. The children of slaves are released, and join the rest of the population as \"Macehualtin\", the peasant class of our society."
 msg_arrival_events.11.a:0 "But we are still Spartans, right?"
 msg_arrival_events.5.t:0 "Spartan Expansion"
 msg_arrival_events.5.d:0 "We have secured the landing beaches and many of the cities surrounding Lakonya. Our population has now greatly increased along with our army. However, with that comes a decrease in discipline as we bring new soldiers into the fold. It matters not how strict our discipline is, as these new warriors have neither experience nor training. Nevertheless, we must continue to expand our control over the natives."  
 msg_arrival_events.5.a:0 "This was inevitable"
 msg_arrival_events.6.t:0 "Spartan Dominance"
 msg_arrival_events.6.d:0 "We now control almost all of the land that was once part of the Aztec and Mayan empires, and other than the elite members of our society or historians, most of our subjects barely remember the story of our arrival to this land as it actually happened."
 msg_arrival_events.6.a:0 "What a nice story!"
 msg_arrival_events.10.t:0 "Foreigners Arrive"
 msg_arrival_events.10.d:0 "Aggressive foreigners have invaded our land and established a small city near the coast. Dressed in strange clothing, and brandishing weapons made of an unknown material, they are like nothing we have ever seen. Luckily, we vastly outnumber them and should be able to drive them off."
 msg_arrival_events.10.a:0 "Pray to the Gods for mercy!"
 mesoamerican_landing:0 "East Coast"
 nhs_prevent_vassalisation:0 "A document will be signed, preventing us from directly interfering with their politics for 50 years after the establishment of their first settlement."
 MSG_DOMINANCE_LEO_LIVES_TT:0 "They instead tell of the great Hero Leonidas, a living legend! He sailed across the seas to this land, and should he leave this mortal land he still shall return in our time of need."
 MSG_DOMINANCE_LEO_DEAD_TT:0 "They instead tell a legend of our national hero Leonidas, who led the Three-Hundred to this land and will return to save the Spartans in their time of need."
