Gradually his appreciation for the works written about the fall of Troy and the adventures of its heroes increases and it inspires him to consider a bold move.

Aeneas in Vergil's Aeneid was forced to flee the city and was led by Jupiter and Venus to found the city Lavinium after a great Odyssey of his own. This city would later be known as the city from which Romulus and Remus's mother originated. Now it is time for the Byzantines to embark on the Third Odyssey...\n\nWill you lead the faltering Romans to a New World?"
