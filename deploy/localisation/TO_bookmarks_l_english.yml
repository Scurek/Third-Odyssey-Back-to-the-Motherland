 BOOKMARK_FLIGHT_OF_THE_BYZANTINES:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 BOOKMARK_FLIGHT_OF_THE_BYZANTINES_DESC:0 "Experience an alternate history where the Emperor of the Romans ponders the state of his declining realm and sees only one solution: to leave it all behind and start somewhere new. A radical solution, caused by the slow realization that both the east and the west were hostile to the empire and wish only for its slow destruction. The Romans know their task is just as difficult as what their ancient forefathers faced. Odysseus fared west, and so too did Aeneas. The Romans will flee even farther west than that, beyond the Pillars of Hercules and beyond the shores of Europe. They will fare to a land where the sun rises on the eastern shore and sets inland. They will venture to a New World.\n\nWill their Third Odyssey be successful? Will you lead the faltering Romans to prosperity?"
