 nhs_mission_events.51.d:0 "It has always been the story of a city, and the dream that inspired it. If Roma was the embodiment of ambition, Constantinople was of determination. Determination to endure, to survive, to preserve what little remained in this ever changing, hostile world. The same that fuelled long-gone emperors and the fearless peoples that followed them across the horizon, through treacherous seas and hidden lands.\n\nAs brave explorers and battered refugees landed in mysterious coasts, a new city, a new dream, was born. One of survival, one of renewal. In Nea Konstantinoupolis, refuge was offered from above in the form of Elysium, sheltering the lost sons of an empire thought lost by all. The city: a lonely candle surrounded by darkness, and last remains of the light that once was.\n\nWhat now many think as ineludible and predestined, was never so. For centuries, every baker, bureaucrat, merchant, soldier, brother and sister, kept Nea Konstantinoupolis alive. From inside the walls or out in the provinces, every citizen knew what was at stake by keeping the last light from burning out. For only time, and that ancient, inherited determination, would let it shine as bright as before. Perhaps even more.\n\nFrom then on, they marched home. Through perilous seas, pretenders, and conquerors, the old banner landed on Constantinople. As one city embraced the other, so did their dreams: Restoration. Italia, the cradle of it all, awaited. Roma was next.\n\nWith Europe and beyond waking up from their long stupor, we do so too. We wake up to see an empire restored, no longer a dream. Kings and princes bow before us, accepting -by reason or force- our solemn, supreme authority upon the world. Through blood, loss, strength, and glory, we have prevailed. The long night is over. Dawn is here. \n\nThe story of three cities is now one. A so, new chapter begins.\n\nWe made our cities the world, and the world, our city. Rome.\n                                                                                                  - Leandros Epipleon,\n                                                                                                   Imperial Chronicler"

Even your very origins are noble: Way back to Aeneas escaping from a burning Troy and his descendants founding Rome, to the original empire standing strong until old Roma was overtaken by Constantinople, whose walls would hold out the inevitable for a thousand years. Such is the mantle you carry, the responsibility that rests upon your shoulders. \n\nUnlike our forefathers, the land we call home has a much more recent history, though at first glance it had belonged to us for centuries: the cities that dot the coasts, our paved roads, forts and, of course, the palaces and churches that populate our capital. Once nothing but a refugee camp, now rises as a shining beacon of culture, wealth, and -of course- power. Armies march to the sound of chants and music, architects design and engineers build marvels that wonder every foreigner whose sight are set upon, and on top of it all, our green-gold flag flies proud under the Atlantic winds. Has someone seen a civilization that has managed so much in so little time? Some say that we, Elysians, are way too ambitious. But what better field to grow ambition than heaven-delivered Elysium? \n\nIt is from burgeoning [950.GetName] that the world knows, fears, and respect us. Ships come and go in the name of wealth and dominance. The magnificent city of Prosphorion, our great port and door to Nea Konstantinoupolis, is just the first step towards the greater Elysian dominium. Europe, the so-called ‘Old World’, is nothing but an extension of our manifested destiny. Where not so long-ago small kingdoms and nations squabbled over the ruins of our forefathers, now order and peace has been re-established. Even Africa and the dilapidated Levant now bask in the prosperity provided by Elysian arms and law. \n\nSome dare to compare us to Roma and the old empire. To Constantinople and its thousand-years old inheritance. We bow to both cities, recognizing their place in history and the part they played in our ancestry. But we have learnt from the past, and now lay claim to the future. The reconquest is finished: Where Rome failed, we have prevailed. \n\nOur ancestors’ debt is settled. A new era starts, Elysia's.\n                                                                                                  - Leandros Epipleon,\n                                                                                                   Imperial Chronicler"

Daring skirmishes on the frontier by him and his Janissaries have earned him the respect, if not admiration, of most of the Emperor's court, and now he appears before [Root.Monarch.GetName] once again with a proposal. He seeks to establish a new Janissary regiment, perhaps several, by recruiting from the young Barbaroi, especially those who have been orphaned in the previous conflicts. These recruits would be educated in the Greek language, instilled with the True Faith, and subjected to rigorous discipline akin to the Janissaries who were once deployed against us.\n\nWhile the proposal is in itself pragmatic, many are worried that this would alienate the local populace from us, without whom we cannot hope to thrive while stranded here. Others point out the expense, which could be better used on expanding our existing militia. However, the prevailing sentiment seems to stem from a simple and singular aversion rooted in our past experiences at the hands of such troops."

Over time, these regiments, dubbed the Prinkipes by our people as a tribute to the prince, have more than proven themselves defending the frontier towns. With the recent reforms, however, we can no longer tolerate the existence of such independent armed forces within our territory, no matter how well intended.

 nhs2_mainlandevents.42.da:0 "In 1195, Isaakios Angelos was deposed from the Purple by his brother Alexios. Eight years later, the son of Isaakios - also named Alexios - would court disaster by promising the Venetian-backed knights of the Fourth Crusade extravagant gifts and exorbitant bribes in return for restoring his father to the throne. The perfidious Venetians, not content with placing their puppet on the throne in 1203, kept their army encamped and grew bolder and bolder. Finally they sacked the Queen of Cities in 1204, dividing the Roman Empire in half with their 'Partitio Romaniæ,' which saw all the lands from the Golden Horn to the Ionian Sea shorn from the empire. In addition, many priceless artifacts were looted and stolen and taken to Venice itself, while the masterminds of that treachery died fat and happy after long lives. Now the tables are turned: [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers are marching into Venice and some isolated looting has already begun. Some of the officers are advising reigning in the troops and showing mercy, claiming that Venice is a strategically important city located on the nexus of roads leading from Italy to the Balkans, and also controls the Adriatic trading routes - and also that a sacking of Venice would turn the great courts of Europe against our realm. One general has pushed back at this talk, claiming that the great courts of Europe have always hated us ever since the days of Charlemagne, and that we might as well give them a valid reason to be displeased. 'Put the entire city to the sword, for Venice has been the downfall of our empire,' he says.\n\nIn any event, we should send the Turks a gift of thanks for destroying the tomb of Enrico Dandolo, who was buried in the Hagia Sophia."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.42.db:0 "In 1203, the struggling Venetian-backed Frankish crusaders accepted an offer from the son of deposed emperor Isaakios II begging the crusader army to intervene and place the man back on the throne; in recompense, he would use the vast wealth of the Roman Empire to speed the crusaders safely to the Holy Land. This promise went unfulfilled. Alexios IV and Isaakios II acted in good faith, but the empire was too poor from the disastrous mismanagement of the Angeloi to pay for the transportation of the crusader knights. The Venetians, who bankrolled the crusader knights at a very low cost, knew they were losing money from a failed investment, but were loathe to turn on a man dealing with them in good faith, and knew better than to try to wring blood from a stone. Alexios V Doukas Mourtzouphlos, on the other hand, had Alexios IV Angelos executed, offered battle several times with the Latins, and finally had all Latins expelled from Konstantinoupolis. This was the final straw: the Venetians and their Frankish allies could either take the city or starve to death in the heart of hostile territory. And if they had to crush a rotten apple to do it, they wouldn't think twice.\n\n...or at least such has been the narrative pushed by influential Venetian merchants in the early years of the exile. This narrative, which paints the Venetians as, if not blameless, at least understandable and not outright villains - and furthermore paints the Romans as the ironic authors of their own demise - has taken root in the [Root.GetAdjective] psyche. The Fourth Crusade, once seen as western intolerance and perfidy, has transformed into an ironic tale of hubristic downfall. Thus, while the army marches into Venice, there is no grand sack, no burning the city down to the foundations in misplaced vengeance. Some looting has erupted, but the generals are urging caution and restraint in the troops."

But unlike its predecessor this bold proposal suggests entrusting provincial administration almost exclusively to local nobility and prominent figures, supported, of course, by our forces and bureaucratic apparatus.\n\nThe proposed decentralized model promises to ease the integration of new subjects into the imperial fold and reduce the risk of frontier uprisings. Nevertheless, skepticism can be found among the courtiers, many of whom are concerned this could lead to internal power struggles, given the recent trend towards increased centralisation. Despite the uncertainties, the new Exarchate system has reached the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], presenting a promising vision for the future of our expanding empire."

From our homes to our traditions, and even many of our brothers and sisters, those who made the journey did so despite being forced to give up more than we can ever know, and with no certainty of a future.\n\nBut our ancestors were not alone on that journey. Skanderbeg of Albania joined us on that great crossing along with many of his followers, and they carved out their homes in Elysium as we did.\n\nNow that we have returned to our ancestral motherland, to Constantinople, our steadfast companions are asking questions of their own homeland. Albania does indeed fall within the newest set of borders we have carved into our maps, the latest reconquest acquired. And so the Kastrioti, descendants of Skanderbeg himself, come before us and ask for their lands to be returned. They will serve us faithfully from now until the end of days if we but restore them to Albania and the title of King beneath our Imperial Crown.\n\nBut they were invited long ago, in a more desperate time. We could install them as governors and deny them a royal title if we so choose. Or why even grant them the land at all? Why yield in our moment of triumph, based on oaths sworn under duress in our moment of greatest weakness, as opposed to rewarding those who were much more instrumental in reclaiming the land in the first place?"
