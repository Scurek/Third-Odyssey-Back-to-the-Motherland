 nhs2_countryevents.38.d:0 "Many old nobles were brought along with us in our exile from Europe. Some of these men have imperial claims from ages long ago; and now that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has no chosen heir, the families are clamouring for one of their members to be named Symbasileus — co-emperor and the anointed successor to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. While most are skilled only in courtly intrigue, more suited to scheming than governing, a few still possess the strength and vision required to the beleaguered Roman Empire in Elysium.\n\nYet there is another path to consider. Rather than yield to the rather self-serving petitions of the noble houses, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could revive an earlier tradition and adopt a new heir. This would be politically unpopular, but would allow the continuity of the dynasty, a powerful symbol of stability in these dire times."
