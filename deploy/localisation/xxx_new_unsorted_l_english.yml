 nhs_grand_harbour_monument_desc:0 "Scholars have discovered a Hellenistic book dating back to before the destruction of Carthage describing the architecture of their famous grand harbour, known as a Cothon. Some scholars suggest this is mostly made up or originates primarily from aggrandised stories, as ancient historians had a tendency to do. Nevertheless, the design seems very interesting and building a great new harbour district would boost the wealth of our ports in Didymo Fylakes tremendously since demand for trade is rising steadily."

 nhs_found_grand_library_desc:0 "The original library of Alexandria, which probably contained many great works of which no copies exist to date, was destroyed in a fire in dubious circumstances. It is possible the rising Christians caused this to happen during religious conflicts with pagan philosophers, but historical records tend to favor the victor; or, in contrast, contemporary losers might criminalise them out of spite. Whatever the case, much was lost that day. We do now have a rather large selection of works, old and new, and it might be beneficial to open up a library to the public; with adjacent educational institutes, we may encourage even greater scientific advancement."
