Determination to endure, to survive, to preserve what little remained in this ever changing, hostile world. The same that fueled long-gone emperors and the fearless peoples that followed them across the horizon, through treacherous seas and hidden lands.\n\nAs brave explorers and battered refugees landed in mysterious coasts, a new city, a new dream, was born. One of survival, one of renewal. In Nea Konstantinoupolis, refuge was offered from above in the form of Elysium, sheltering the lost sons of an empire thought lost by all. The city: a lonely candle surrounded by darkness, and last remains of the light that once was.\n\nWhat now many think as ineludible and predestined, was never so. For centuries, every baker, bureaucrat, merchant, soldier, brother and sister, kept Nea Konstantinoupolis alive. From inside the walls or out in the provinces, every citizen knew what was at stake by keeping the last light from burning out. For only time, and that ancient, inherited determination, would let it shine as bright as before. Perhaps even more.\n\nFrom then on, they marched home. Through perilous seas, pretenders, and conquerors, the old banner landed on Constantinople. As one city embraced the other, so did their dreams: Restoration. Italia, the cradle of it all, awaited. Roma was next.\n\nWith Europe and beyond waking up from their long stupor, we do so too. We wake up to see an empire restored, no longer a dream. Kings and princes bow before us, accepting -by reason or force- our solemn, supreme authority upon the world. Through blood, loss, strenght, and glory, we have prevailed. The long night is over. Dawn is here. \n\nThe story of three cities is now one. A so, new chapter begins.\n\nWe made our cities the world, and the world, our city. Rome.\n                                                                                                  - Leandros Epipleon,\n                                                                                                   Imperial Chronicler"

Even your very origins are noble: Way back to Aeneas escaping from a burning Troy and his descendants founding Rome, to the original empire standing strong until old Roma was overtaken by Constantinople, whose walls would hold out the inevitable for a thousand years. Such is the mantle you carry, the responsibility that rests upon your shoulders. \n\nUnlike our forefathers, the land we call home has a much more recent history, though at first glance it had belonged to us for centuries: the cities that dot the coasts, our paved roads, forts and, of course, the palaces and churches that populate our capital. Once nothing but a refugee camp, now rises as a shining beacon of culture, wealth, and -of course- power. Armies march to the sound of chants and music, architects design and engineers build marvels that wonder every foreigner whose sight are set upon, and on top of it all, our green-gold flag flies proud under the Atlantic winds. Has someone seen a civilization that has managed so much in so little time? Some say that we, Elysians, are way too ambitious. But what better field to grow ambition than heaven-delivered Elysium? \n\nIt is from burgeoning Ivos that the world knows, fears, and respect us. Ships come and go in the name of wealth and dominance. The magnificent city of Prosphorion, our great port and door to Nea Konstantinoupolis, is just the first step towards the greater Elysian dominium. Europe, the so-called ‘Old World’, is nothing but an extension of our manifested destiny. Where not so long-ago small kingdoms and nations squabbled over the ruins of our forefathers, now order and peace has been reestablished. Even Africa and the dilapidated Levant now bask in the prosperity provided by Elysian arms and law. \n\nSome dare to compare us to Roma and the old empire. To Constantinople and its thousand-years old inheritance. We bow to both cities, recognizing their place in history and the part they played in our ancestry. But we have learnt from the past, and now lay claim to the future. The reconquest is finished: Where Rome failed, we have prevailed. \n\nOur ancestors’ debt is settled. A new era starts, Elysia's.\n                                                                                                  - Leandros Epipleon,\n                                                                                                   Imperial Chronicler"
