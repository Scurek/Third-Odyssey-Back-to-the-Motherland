 nhs_farming_mission_desc_with_supplies:0 "This new world has thus far shown itself to be one of promise and fertility, though not without its difficulties. Finding crops that would flourish in this land was difficult, and much of our previous knowledge and techniques were useless when trying to conquer the hardy soil, but through perseverance and careful cultivation of a few choice seed species, we have managed to establish a flourishing agriculture in this once empty land.\n\nNow that the food flows in true bounty, the people are almost flocking to the fields to work towards the better tomorrow, their hearts brimming with hope just as the granaries brim with grain and more exotic plants native to this land. This new world looks set to carry us all together to a better tomorrow."
 nhs_farming_mission_desc_without_supplies:0 "It has been a difficult time adjusting to this new land, and most troubling of all has been the local crops. Those we brought from home have found it nigh on impossible to take root in this foreign soil, while those native to this land do not respond to our old methods as well as they should. Careful Rationing and foraging what we could from the land have been able to sustain us for some time.\n\nBut now finally those measures can be done away with. With careful help from more friendly natives, we have come to tame this land and know it just as well as we did our old. Irrigation ditches have been dug and fertile fields are now overflowing with the first of our new crops just waiting for the harvest. A year of plenty is upon us now, and we can only hope for many more to come."
 nhs_unite_home_region_mission_desc:0 "Against all odds we are victorious. After centuries of toil and struggle, of slowly losing ground, of fighting increasingly long odds, our final gambit has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams and led us again to greatness. When we sailed west across the Atlantic aboard a fleet of not-entirely-seaworthy ships, it was the last chance of a dying empire to avoid certain destruction. Now we are strong. The whole coastline from the Vinlandic frontier to the tip of the continent is under our sphere of influence, and we control a goodly portion of the islands in the Kykladian Archipelago. Like Aeneas before us, we have landed here a motley collection of refugees in barely-seaworthy ships and we have expanded to conquer and rule all we survey. Our work is not done yet, but we can rest easy and breathe a sigh of relief that our very existence is no longer under peril. For the first time since the days of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer, we have secured for ourselves a place in the sun."
