 nhs_grand_harbour_monument_desc:0 "Scholars have discovered a Hellenistic book dating back to before the destruction of Carthage describing the architecture of their famous grand harbour, known as a Cothon. Some scholars suggest this is mostly made up or originates primarily from aggrandised stories, as ancient historians had a tendency to do. Nevertheless, the design seems very interesting and building a great new harbour district would boost the wealth of our ports in Didymo Fylakes tremendously since demand for trade is rising steadily."

 nhs_found_grand_library_desc:0 "The original library of Alexandria, which probably contained many great works of which no copies exist to date, was destroyed in a fire in dubious circumstances. It is possible the rising Christians caused this to happen during religious conflicts with pagan philosophers, but historical records tend to favor the victor; or, in contrast, contemporary losers might criminalise them out of spite. Whatever the case, much was lost that day. We do now have a rather large selection of works, old and new, and it might be beneficial to open up a library to the public; with adjacent educational institutes, we may encourage even greater scientific advancement."

 to_nat_haudenosaunee.1.t: "The Great Peacemaker"
 to_nat_haudenosaunee.1.da: "A man came before the clan today, speaking words of peace. Many have spoken such words before, trying to end the bloodshed between the many clans of this fertile land, or otherwise to direct their raids away from those they care for and towards different targets. But this man was different. The words he spoke rang soundly where others rang hollow. His vision he described so vividly that there was not a person seated around the campfire that did not find themselves enthralled by it as if they could see it themselves.\n\nWhen he spoke, all the world listened. This man, who named himself Deganawida, though already men speak of him using the name Peacemaker, invited all who had gathered to hear him speak, come listen to him again some months from now at the Lake of Onondaga where he plans to speak again. Not before a single clan, but before entire nations.\n\nThus far, there has not been a single voice who has said they shall not go."

But this man was different. The words he spoke rang soundly where others rang hollow. His vision he described so vividly that there was not a person seated around the campfire that did not find themselves enthralled by it as if they could see it themselves.\n\nYet there were those who doubted. Who rejected his message and claimed him a liar. The Peacemaker offered no rebuttals or denials, but instead made an offer. To prove his purity and spirituality, he would climb to the very top of a tree just beside the falls, where upon our warriors were to cut the tree down. The entire clan gathered to watch as he vanished over the falls, disappearing into the rapids below where he would surely die, either from the fall or from being drowned in the swirling vortex below.\n\nThe next day we awoke to find him seated at the campfire alive and well. A miracle. Impressed by his survival, the Clan Mothers and Chiefs have agreed to spread the tale to all the Mohawk, and travel together to meet at the Onondaga lake in some weeks time to hear him speak his message of peace once again."

 to_nat_haudenosaunee.2.t: "The Great Law of Peace"
 to_nat_haudenosaunee.2.d: "The arrival of the many clans to Onondaga lake was heralded by a darkening of the sky, the sun itself hiding from view to be replaced by a hole of black that seared away at the sky around it. The people, frightened by this strange event, hurried to find shelter, and there upon they arrived at the home of a woman. Jigonhsasee, ally of the Peacemaker, was what she introduced herself as. As people from all the many clans arrived she welcomed all at her hearth, offering food and good council, and ensuring none struck against each other.\n\nFinally the day came where The Peacemaker arrived to speak again his vision of a single united commonwealth, where killing would be replaced by thinking, and all would be united as a single family. And as he continued to speak, all listened well for they knew that history was taking place before them. They listened now to a Great Man.\n\nHis teaching, the laws he wished to build for all to live beneath, we called the Great Law of Peace. And at the lakeside he planted a Tree of Peace, proclaiming that its roots should spread in all directions, any nation that wished to join in their peace need only follow those roots back to their source and take shelter beneath its branches.\n\nFive Nations had there been there that day. Five nations there were still when down the sun set. But what was there now, that was not before, was a Family."

We thought these farcical reports barely worth listening to, or perhaps people confused and believing the Vinlanders have returned to the south.\n\nBut after sending a few scouts to investigate, we found all the rumours to be true and more. These strangers dress in clothing the likes of which we have never seen, while they perform unnatural rituals, and speak in a foul new tongue no warrior, chief or clan mother has ever heard before. The talk of these new aliens puts our people at ill ease."
