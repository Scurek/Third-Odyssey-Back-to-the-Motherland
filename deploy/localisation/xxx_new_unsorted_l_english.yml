As such securing a safe path, for our merchants, around Africa must be among our first priorities. We can accomplish this in two ways. We can regain control of the old provinces of Mauretania, Africa, Cyrenaica and Aegyptus and once again enjoy the rich trade of the Sea of Hercules. If we don't wish to challenge the rulers who control those lands, we could open new trade routes by controlling the coasts of sub-Saharan Africa and sailing round the Cape of Storms. But we risk conflict with the colonial holding of European nations and native kingdoms wishing to retain their trade dominance. Whatever route we choose it will open the way to the riches of India and lands beyond."

He set out from Europe intent on finding the way all the way East to India, in his effort to prove the roundness of the Earth. What he found instead was us, and the flourishing Elysium we have built. He returned to Europe with our exotic goods and Barbaroi slaves, and became renowned as the first trader to cross the Atlantic. But his dream of sailing West to India was never fulfilled.\n\nTo complete his journey and accomplish his dream, we will need to cross the Eirenic ocean, the largest and most unexplored stretch of water known to civilised man. To others this might be intimidating, but we are [GetElysiansRomans]. We crossed the Atlantic with a fleet larger than the world has ever seen, and since Columbus' voyage, our mariners have truly mastered the crossing of the Atlantic ocean, sailing from Ivos to as far flung ports as Archangelsk. If there are any people who can complete the voyage across the Eirenic, it is [GetElysiansRomans]."

And yet the Eirenic remains an almost undiscovered country.\n\nAn Italian Sailor known as Christopher Columbus believed that the world was round, and that by sailing west you can reach the far east and acquire the many riches of Asia, but our flight left Europe unenthused with the idea of sailing westwards. Now, the potential remains. We shall sail west to reach the east, and if the markets of Asia are to be found, we shall seize them with both hands."

A Roman province for so long that the population still speaks a variant of Latin to this day, the recovery of this ancient Roman heartland will also greatly ease the passage of trade to and from Elysia, bringing new prosperity to our ascendant Empire.\n\nThe last time these lands saw Roman rule was under Constantine the Great, nearly a century ago.

Full of scholars, artists, and craftsmen without peer, it is obvious that these \"Italians\" have learned only from the very best. Hundreds of thousands of these people now flock to watch our procession walk through the gates of the Aurelian Walls, and historians will record the tears of joy cried by our triumphant generals.\n\nOh, Eternal City!"

Forced to fend for themselves the struggles between the native Britons, Celts and their invaders saw rise to a number of different petty kings and other rulers. They have allowed almost all of the gifts of civilization bestowed upon this land by Rome to fall apart and decay.

In our absence the plain has descended into chaos: Slavs, Germans and even Mongols took to the region. The few vestigial hints of Roman influence are naught but echoes, distortion of a glorious past cannibalised for the sake of pretenders - or twisted by barbarians with aspirations of legitimisation. But this has all been brought to heel; we have torn down the Magyars, decimated the Wallachians, rid our rightful province of Slavic invaders and opportunistic Germans. We have returned."

Some advisors have suggested simply ceding the city back to the Bishop of Rome as a sign of respect for his status as one of the preeminent figures of Christendom, and thus avoid invoking the ire of other Catholic powers. The second option is to brand the so-called Pope and his cardinals as heretics, but allow them to leave the city unmolested. Finally, we could put the Pope on trial for heresy, and while this will certainly be sweet revenge for our people, who have faced so many hardships from the Church of Rome, it would also infuriate every Catholic across the globe.
