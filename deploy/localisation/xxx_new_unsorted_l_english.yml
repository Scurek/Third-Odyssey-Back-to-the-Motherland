 nhs2_countryevents.38.d:0 "Many old nobles were brought along with us in our exile from Europe. Some of these men have imperial claims from ages long ago; and now that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has no chosen heir, the families are clamouring for one of their members to be named Symbasileus — co-emperor and the anointed successor to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. While most are skilled only in courtly intrigue, more suited to scheming than governing, a few still possess the strength and vision required to the beleaguered Roman Empire in Elysium.\n\nYet there is another path to consider. Rather than yield to the rather self-serving petitions of the noble houses, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could revive an earlier tradition and adopt a new heir. This would be politically unpopular, but would allow the continuity of the dynasty, a powerful symbol of stability in these dire times."

 nhs_monuments.100.d:0 "If one were to consider [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as the heart of our beloved empire, the mighty Andronika would be the veins and arteries of trade bringing wealth and prosperity to wherever its streams flow. Yet even now we aren't exploiting the full potential of this vital river. At least today we are partially rectifying this mistake by integrating the riverlands into our highway network."

And when we travelled across the Great Ocean and reached the shores of Elysium, the Elysian Bay and [953.GetCapitalName] nearly became both our cradle and our tomb. Yet we not only survived, we flourished. The destiny of the continent lies in our hands and we have proven so once again with the completion of the newest section of the Elysian Highway.\n\nThe Highway is a great accomplishment for our people. In the past smaller cities were always at the mercy of local bandits and savage Barbaroi. Thus, much of our trade had to be conducted at sea where our ships are under the threat of pirates and European navies. Now there exists the alternative of the safe Elysian Highways, patrolled by our proud soldiers. The future looks bright for [Root.GetName]."

The streets are filled with people, both Roman and Norse, celebrating over this great accomplishment with [Root.GetAdjective] placenta cake and Norse mead."
 nhs_monuments.102.db:0 "When we arrived in Elysium it did not take long for us to make contact with our neighbours in the north, wild savages that escaped the chilling clutches of northern Europe known as Scandinavia. They practised a brutal religion, offering human sacrifices to their bloodthirsty gods. Our people were never safe with them running amok, raiding our coasts with their longboats.\n\nYet even after our legions marched north and conquered mighty Vinland, we were not able to truly control the Norsemen. Our armies were needed on many fronts, stretched thin fighting against uncooperative natives as well as the greedy Europeans. Today, however, our proud soldiers are able to march north quicker than ever before thanks to the completion of another section of the Elysian Highway."

Great artists such as the famed Vinlander, Biegeltoren, who painted "The Flight", have produced works of art that are now regarded as national treasures and icons.\n\nYet unfortunately in the eyes of our bureaucrats and officials it is also seen as a land of troublemakers as well as dissidents, trying to escape the grasp of our capital in the east. Due to this and the rather troubling obstacle that is the Atlasian mountain range our governors and the imperial army always had trouble dealing with our western provinces. But no longer. The Elysian Highway now stretches itself across the entirety of the Elysium, consolidating our grip on the continent."

They constructed roads and great aqueducts, bringing fresh water to our ever-expanding cities.\n\nWe have faced a similar challenge in the west, the Atlasian Mountains.¸Our struggle was great, but through sweat, tears and blood we have completed another section of the Elysian Highway, connecting our western lands. The many settlements and mines of the mountains shall unearth precious minerals, bringing even greater prosperity to [Root.GetName]."

The latest section of the Elysian Highway has been completed, carving an unbroken path through the rugged terrain and binding the south ever closer to our dominion. Trade now flows freely, troops march unhindered, and our influence in the region has never been stronger.\n\nWhether as a means of governance, conquest, or alliance, the highway stands as a testament to our unyielding will and the boundless ambition that drives us.

There are few towns and fewer cities there; it is all cattle country."

The captain of the first band of settlers in the region, it is said, looked at the plot of grassy dirt that they had claimed and was asked if it was everything he had wished for when he desired an open grassland suitable for a farm. His response, allegedly and legendarily, was: 'Tha kánei' - 'It'll do.'\n\nThe settlers embraced the phrase, proudly calling their land and themselves by it. 'Where are you from?' 'Tha Kanei.' Their blatant disrespect for the Greek language is utterly infuriating, and it's not even a particularly great patch of dirt, either. The half-savages claimed a land that was admittedly slightly better than the jungle to their north, and then they had the gall to give it such a vulgar name as--"

 nhs2_cultureevents.32.t:0 "The People of the Heights"
 nhs2_cultureevents.32.d:0 "The tribesmen of the southern mountains lack the organized state apparatus of their northern neighbors, which makes them simultaneously easier and harder to civilize. They clung stubbornly to their old traditions even as large numbers of colonists from the homeland arrived and compelled them to adopt new ways. Of course, the influence ran both ways: even the most proper [Root.GetAdjective] settlers began parading in barbarian attire and picking up foreign words. We have taken to calling them the 'Psilavounoi' - roughly, 'the mountain men'."

Already, they dress in our style, write in our alphabet, and speak a curious mingling of Greek and their native tongue. They call themselves Ketsoua — a Hellenized echo of Quechua.\n\nThese highland peoples, who once ruled what passed for an empire in these parts, have little use for horses, yet have taken to the mule with enthusiasm. Their nobles, adorned in local finery shaped to our fashion, now appear in the courts of [Root.Capital.GetName], learning our tongue and our laws.\n\nThey are not yet [Root.GetAdjective], but they could be."

In the market squares, traders speak in a lively blend of the old and the new, words of the highlands mingling with those of the settlers. [Root.GetAdjective] stonework rises alongside terraced fields; mountain feasts now feature dishes flavored with spices brought from across the sea.\n\nColonists adopt native weaving patterns, highland nobles send their sons to learn Greek, and marriages between the two peoples are now common. A shared identity is emerging, neither purely Ketsoua nor purely Psilavounoi, but something born from both.\n\nIn time, historians may argue over who absorbed whom.
