 nhs_grand_harbour_monument_desc:0 "Scholars have discovered a Hellenistic book dating back to before the destruction of Carthage describing the architecture of their famous grand harbour, known as a Cothon. Some scholars suggest this is mostly made up or originates primarily from aggrandised stories, as ancient historians had a tendency to do. Nevertheless, the design seems very interesting and building a great new harbour district would boost the wealth of our ports in Didymo Fylakes tremendously since demand for trade is rising steadily."
