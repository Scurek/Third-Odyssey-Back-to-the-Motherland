 nhs2_countryevents.38.d:0 "Many old nobles were brought along with us in our exile from Europe. Some of these men have imperial claims from ages long ago; and now that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has no chosen heir, the families are clamouring for one of their members to be named Symbasileus — co-emperor and the anointed successor to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. While most are skilled only in courtly intrigue, more suited to scheming than governing, a few still possess the strength and vision required to the beleaguered Roman Empire in Elysium.\n\nYet there is another path to consider. Rather than yield to the rather self-serving petitions of the noble houses, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could revive an earlier tradition and adopt a new heir. This would be politically unpopular, but would allow the continuity of the dynasty, a powerful symbol of stability in these dire times."

 nhs_monuments.100.t:0 "Andronikan Highway Completed"
 nhs_monuments.100.d:0 "If one were to consider [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as the heart of our beloved empire, the mighty Andronika would be the veins and arteries of trade bringing wealth and prosperity to wherever its streams flow. Yet even now we aren't exploiting the full potential of this vital river. At least today we are partially rectifying this mistake by integrating the riverlands into our highway network."

 nhs_monuments.101.t:0 "Coastal Highway Completed"
 nhs_monuments.101.d:0 "Rome was the cradle of our ancient empire. About a century ago, Constantinople almost became our tomb. And when we travelled across the Great Ocean and reached the shores of Elysium, the Elysian Bay and [953.GetCapitalName] nearly became both our cradle and our tomb. Yet we not only survived, we flourished. The destiny of the continent lies in our hands and we have proven so once again with the completion of the newest section of the Elysian Highway.\n\nThe Highway is a great accomplishment for our people. In the past smaller cities were always at the mercy of local bandits and savage Barbaroi. Thus, much of our trade had to be conducted at sea where our ships are under the threat of pirates and European navies. Now there exists the alternative of the safe Elysian Highways, patrolled by our proud soldiers. The future looks bright for [Root.GetName]."

 nhs_monuments.102.t:0 "Vinlandic Highway Completed"
 nhs_monuments.102.da:0 "When we arrived in Elysium it did not take long for us to make contact with our neighbours in the north. Over the decades a simple trading agreement would blossom into a stalwart alliance of exiles.\n\nToday marks an important day in [Root.GetAdjective]-Vinlandic relations as we further tie the Norsemen to the destiny of [Root.GetName] with the completion of the Vinlandic Elysian Highway. The streets are filled with people, both Roman and Norse, celebrating over this great accomplishment with [Root.GetAdjective] placenta cake and Norse mead."
 nhs_monuments.102.db:0 "When we arrived in Elysium it did not take long for us to make contact with our neighbours in the north, wild savages that escaped the chilling clutches of northern Europe known as Scandinavia. They practised a brutal religion, offering human sacrifices to their bloodthirsty gods. Our people were never safe with them running amok, raiding our coasts with their longboats.\n\nYet even after our legions marched north and conquered mighty Vinland, we were not able to truly control the Norsemen. Our armies were needed on many fronts, stretched thin fighting against uncooperative natives as well as the greedy Europeans. Today, however, our proud soldiers are able to march north quicker than ever before thanks to the completion of another section of the Elysian Highway."

Without a doubt the most majestic of said jewels would be our capital, [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\n\nAnother magnificent gem would be the city of Kahokia. Originally constructed by Barbaroi, we have since taken control over this beautiful and strategically important city. Our grip on the city and wider area strengthens further today with the completion of another section of the Elysian Highway, adding another gemstone to the Imperial Crown."

 nhs_monuments.104.d:0 "Hesperidia. In the eyes of our people, it is often romanticized as a land of artists and free thinkers. Great artists such as the famed Vinlander, Biegeltoren, who painted "The Flight", have produced works of art that are now regarded as national treasures and icons.\n\nYet unfortunately in the eyes of our bureaucrats and officials it is also seen as a land of troublemakers as well as dissidents, trying to escape the grasp of our capital in the east. Due to this and the rather troubling obstacle that is the Atlasian mountain range our governors and the imperial army always had trouble dealing with our western provinces. But no longer. The Elysian Highway now stretches itself across the entirety of the Elysium, consolidating our grip on the continent."

 nhs_monuments.105.d:0 "As our forefathers grew accustomed to the lands of Elysium, they started pushing westward and encountered the Appalachian Mountains. Through toil and hard work, they tamed these lands and made them theirs. They constructed roads and great aqueducts, bringing fresh water to our ever-expanding cities.\n\nWe have faced a similar challenge in the west, the Atlasian Mountains.¸Our struggle was great, but through sweat, tears and blood we have completed another section of the Elysian Highway, connecting our western lands. The many settlements and mines of the mountains shall unearth precious minerals, bringing even greater prosperity to [Root.GetName]."

 nhs_monuments.106.d:0 "The Lakonian mountains and valleys, once a formidable barrier, have now been conquered — not by arms, but by the ingenuity and determination of the [Root.GetAdjective] Empire. The latest section of the Elysian Highway has been completed, carving an unbroken path through the rugged terrain and binding the south ever closer to our dominion. Trade now flows freely, troops march unhindered, and our influence in the region has never been stronger.\n\nWhether as a means of governance, conquest, or alliance, the highway stands as a testament to our unyielding will and the boundless ambition that drives us. Lakonia is no longer distant; it is, at last, within our grasp."
