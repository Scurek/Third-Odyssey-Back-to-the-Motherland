 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.1.d:0 "Thank you for trying out the Third Odyssey! You are now playing as one of the forgotten Norse colonies known as [Root.GetName], founded by Leif Eiriksson and Thorfinn Karlsefni, a pair of legendary Viking explorers. Long since forgotten by the people of Europe, it is now the last haven of the Norse culture, where Odin and Thor are still worshipped and people still sacrificed in great Blots.\nYour nation is suffering greatly from the effects of its isolationism. A small population and a lack of organised trade and production facilities are difficult obstacles to overcome, and to make matters worse a deep-rooted rivalry between the remaining Norse colonies is brewing to the point of war!\n\n'Glories to Vinland! Purge the fallen in our homeland! Sail to England and claim it for Tyr! Travel to Roma and hang the Pope in Blot for Odin!'\nGlories to Vinland! Glories!\n         -RedInc"

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.2.d:0 "A group of young explorers have decided to follow in Leif Eiriksson's footsteps and continued excursions through the long river to the south. Upon reaching the end of the river they discovered a great lake, whereupon a number aggressive Skraeling tribes attacked their expedition, forcing them to return home.\nIn honour of Leif Eiriksson we have decided to call this great river 'Eiriksson River'!"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.2.a:0 "A great discovery!"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.3.t:0 "Southern Coast"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.3.d:0 "Several explorers sailed south to explore the continent's coast and discovered a fertile and wealthy land."

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.4.d:0 "A party of explorers, this time escorted by warriors, have finally been able to fully explore the lake at the end of Eiriksson River, and what they found was extraordinary!\nAt the end of the river are several great lakes, each bigger and richer than the last.\nBut even more amazing was the discovery of a giant waterfall! Many of the explorers were said to have cried out when they saw an awe-inspiring rainbow emanating the waterfall. They claim that it must be the fabled Bifrost, the bridge to Asgard!"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.4.a:0 "Unbelievable!"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.5.t:0 "Thorfinn Bay"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.5.d:0 "Some explorers made their way north in search of more sealing and whaling grounds and they were able to find a great bay where several Skraelings live.\nFrom what we gather, the area is extremely rich in both seal colonies and high-quality timber, and we should discuss the possibility of starting a small community in this bay that we deemed to call 'Thorfinn Bay' in honour of the great founder Thorfinn Karlsefni."
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.5.a:0 "A great discovery!"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.6.t:0 "Elysian Bay"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.6.d:0 "Rumours have spread in recent months among both Norsemen and the surrounding Skraelings of potential newcomers to these lands. Though we know little about them, we have received artefacts from the locals along our trade routes that are unlike anything we or the Skraelings are able to create, such as ivory carvings and coins bearing Greek markings. In the Vinland Saga, the Greeks were said to have financed Leif's exploration party by buying several narwhal horns from him. Regardless, we must investigate these claims further and hopefully expand our trade network, for we remember the Greeks being a great target for raiding and trading alike..."
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.6.a:0 "Let's meet these Greeks."
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.7.t:0 "The Elysian City"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.7.d:0 "The delegates have finally arrived at the Greek capital, which they call 'New Constantinople,' or Miklagard in our tongue.\n\nIt is a truly amazing city, filled with countless people and magnificent buildings. So amazed were some in the party that they wondered if they had not died and gone to Valhalla! From what we understand, these Greeks were forcibly exiled from their homelands by savage foreigners, and were only saved by the quick thinking of their Emperor, who led a great fleet across the ocean just like the ancient Norse explorers.\nWhat is truly surprising is that these Greeks, unlike the ones from our sagas, don't worship the White Christ of the Christians but instead worship a plethora of different gods, some of which were quite similar to the Aesir and Vanir.\n\nWhen the diplomatic party finally reached the glittering Imperial Palace, they were received by the fabled Emperor himself. Even with a language barrier between the two cultures, some basic information was exchanged and thus it was agreed that a group of Greek diplomats and explorers would accompany the Norse party to visit and even possibly strike a deal with our people!"

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.8.t:0 "Visitors from the North"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.8.d:0 "We have received a delegation from a previously unknown group of people to the north. They seem to be the remnants of Varangian colonies that were thought abandoned centuries ago. According to historical documents, the Varangians of old made fearsome raiders, and eventually became distinguished traders in their own right, but only because raiding became impossible to accomplish with the advancement of fortifications in Europe. We, along with the natives of this New World we call Elysium, do not have access to such fortifications and are vulnerable to coastal raids by these people. To avoid unneeded conflict, we have decided to send a delegation of our own to the north, to talk with the leaders of these Varangians."

So amazed were some in the party that they wondered if they had not died and gone to Valhalla! From what we understand, these Greeks were forcibly exiled from their homelands by savage foreigners, and were only saved by the quick thinking of their Emperor, who led a great fleet across the ocean just like the ancient Norse explorers.\nTheir worship of the White Christ of theirs brings great concern to our diplomats. According to the old tales, many of our ancestors succumbed to the honeyed words of their priests, forgoing their heritage for this new God.\n\nWhen the diplomatic party finally reached the glittering Imperial Palace, they were received by the fabled Emperor himself. Even with a language barrier between the two cultures, some basic information was exchanged and thus it was agreed that a group of Greek diplomats and explorers would accompany the Norse party to visit and even possibly strike a deal with our people!"

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.11.t:0 "The Varangian Colonies"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.11.d:0 "Our diplomats have finally arrived at the northern Varangian colonies and were quite surprised.\n\nThey were expecting barbaric dwellings filled with horned pale men but instead they found quite the large wooden city that housed a strange mix of both pale and native men. And while one could say this city was underdeveloped by our standards, their apparent success in such terrible isolation was a marvellous sight to behold.\n\nWhen our diplomats were finally received by their leaders, they were given two trade propositions. One with the most northern of the colonies, called Helluland, promising a stable source of naval materials from their ongoing naval operations, and the other with the southern Markland, that proposed instead a wide array of exotic ivory, furs and oils.\nThe northern colonies made it clear that this was a diplomatic play and that accepting one offer would exclude the other."

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.15.t:0 "Traders plan to travel North"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.15.d:0 "Even though we have decided against directly trading with the northern nations, many of our more wealthy traders and merchants have set up an expedition to the north in the hopes of selling their wares at a higher price."
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.15.a:0 "Let them go."

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.17.a:0 "No harm could come of this."
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.17.b:0 "I already said my piece to them."
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.18.t:0 "Northerners propose trade deal"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.18.d:0 "With our blooming relations with our northern neighbours, many merchants, traders, and diplomats keep arriving at our borders and capitals. It has reached a point where they have become a common sight in Elysia and several of our merchants have come us, pleading permission to establish an official trade deal between our two nations."

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.30.t:0 "Vinlandic Exodus"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.30.d:0 "The discovery of Elysia has been a great boon to us, for their mere existence was able to revitalize our previously non-existent merchant sector in a matter of months. This has led to more and more Norse folk seeking to expand, establishing new businesses throughout the fertile empty land surrounding us, and it falls to us to help their struggle, both for the good of the people and the Jarl."

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.31.t:0 "Population Boom"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.31.d:0 "During our trade deal with Elysia, their main selling wares have been food, crops, and planting techniques. This has allowed for a sudden population boom, where more and more Norse folk seek even more land to establish their ever growing family."

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.32.t:0 "Small Population Boom"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.32.d:0 "Even though we are not part of a trade deal with the Elysians, their crops and planting techniques have slowly spread into our lands.

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.33.t:0 "Expansion Becomes Organised"
 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.33.d:0 "As our land grows to encompass more and more territory, we find ourselves in the unenviable position of having to end unrestricted colonization, as too many of our veteran warriors are leaving our regiments and making new lives for themselves on the frontier. Thus, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided to appoint an edict outlawing the migration of the Hirdmen and Huskarls to the frontier."
