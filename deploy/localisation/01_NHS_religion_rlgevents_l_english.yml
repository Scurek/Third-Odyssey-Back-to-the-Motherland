 nhs_religionevents.1.d:0 "While Romans and Hellenes may not really have had much belief in their old Gods, they valued piety and tradition highly nevertheless. You can mock the Gods all you want, but they want to be worshipped and you'd best give them something to avoid risking their wrath. You could sacrifice anything from cattle to food to gold to weapons. These sacrifices could be burnt or thrown into a pit or deep pond. Will you honour the Gods?"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME1A:0 "The Gods deserve respect, we should fear them."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME1B:0 "Hah, let's see what they'll do about it!"
 nhs_religionevents.2.t:0 "The Protector God"
 nhs_religionevents.2.d:0 "Our advisors have been at it for weeks now, bringing up the subject of a new temple nearly every meeting. \"In our wealth, we should not forget to thank the Gods\", they say. There are two popular choices: on the one hand we have Ares, God of War, who has led our people to victory in a dangerous foreign land many times. Worship of Ares in particular would be a big boon to the army and give them the respect they feel they deserve among their citizens. On the other hand there is Poseidon, God of the Sea and Lord of Horses. We may be lacking in the latter, but Poseidon definitely was on our side when we made our way to this new land. Like he did for Aineias, he calmed the storm in our hour of need so we would survive to live another day and settle rich new lands. Many believe we should remember his help and honour him to keep receiving his blessings!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME2A:0 "Devote the temple to Ares, God of War and Destruction!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME2B:0 "Devote the temple to Poseidon, God of the Sea and Lord of Horses!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME2C:0 "We can't afford such extravagance right now."
 nhs_religionevents.4.t:0 "A High Priesthood"
 nhs_religionevents.4.d:0 "Our Pantheon of Gods has great appeal to people from all walks of life, but despite this people are still easily distracted and some don't really care a lot about the Gods. Our lack of religious authority makes for a free and generally accepting stance to religion, but also makes it hard to achieve any meaningful sense of connection between our citizens. If we establish a High Priest for every major God, with the Emperor as Pontifex Basileus (supreme religious leader), able to watch over the piety of our people and make sure the proper rites are performed, that would take away a lot of these concerns."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME4A:0 "Seems like a plan to me!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME4B:0 "We'll focus our efforts elsewhere for now."
 nhs_religionevents.5.t:0 "Expanding the Pantheon"
 nhs_religionevents.5.d:0 "We have encountered so many different Gods it's hard to know which ones are true or not. If there's one thing we have learnt, it's that we don't know them all yet. That's why our High Priests have studied Gods from local populations. Some can be linked to our own, but some are new, and of those new ones, some seem really interesting. The High Priests are now making preparations to expand the Pantheon of Gods, add the unknown stories about our own Gods to the Mythos and introduce the brand new ones to the people. On the other hand there are those High Priests that are concerned that expanding the Pantheon would no longer allow us to worship our historical Gods properly, and after all it is they who helped us in the past. Whatever the case, this internal conflict can't go on for much longer, and it's up to the ruler of Elysia, the one who stands closest to the Gods, to make the right call."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME5A:0 "All true Gods require worshipping, see to it they are honoured!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME5B:0 "Our Gods must be worshipped before all others, we must not forget that!"
 nhs_religionevents.6.t:0 "Local Natives appreciate our Pantheon"
 nhs_religionevents.6.d:0 "The Romans were known to tolerate other religious pantheons and even incorporate them in their own. Worship of Gallic or especially Egyptian Gods by true Romans was not all that uncommon. This makes it easy for us to accept and share knowledge of the Gods. The natives seem to appreciate our beliefs and recognise some of their own Gods, spirits and heroes in different shapes."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME6:0 "This is good."
 nhs_religionevents.7.t:0 "Local Natives bring Gifts"
 nhs_religionevents.7.d:0 "After being encountered by the natives, who are in awe of our ways, some local chiefs have gathered gifts for our people in the hopes we may become friends. Since we can always use the food, tools, materials and manpower they are most welcome! May our nations grow ever closer, so one day we may be able to repay this kindness tenfold!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME7:0 "Their generosity will not be forgotten!"
 nhs_religionevents.8.t:0 "Orthodox Sect becomes Majority"
 nhs_religionevents.8.d:0 "Ever since our people first arrived in the new lands, Orthodoxy had fallen out of favour and those who continued as Christians were often ridiculed and shunned. They weren't being persecuted outright, even though they liked to consider themselves martyrs, but it was no longer socially accepted to worship such a sadistic God - a God that punishes us for reasons we cannot help, a God that stood idly by when we were in need, whilst claiming he is merciful and kind. His worship led indirectly to the decline of our ancestor empire, as explained by the first High Priest in the aftermath of the Great Storm, and the population hates the thought of letting that ever happen again. Nevertheless, some worshippers of Christ remained. And in some isolated communities, they forced their beliefs on everyone. Now it would seem the Christians in one of our provinces have stopped worshipping in secret and even worse, they seem to be in the majority!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME8:0 "Nothing we can do."
 nhs_religionevents.9.t:0 "The Orthodox Revival"
 nhs_religionevents.9.d:0 "The believers of the old Christian faith have gained ground once again. We are doing the best we can to make sure this cult doesn't threaten internal stability, but their mere existence guarantees trouble. We should never forget what these heathens did to the ancient temples, the Library of Alexandria and countless scholars due to their unrelenting fanaticism. How should we deal with these pests?"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME9A:0 "Wait for now, they will see the light eventually."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME9B:0 "Enough, they'll never see light again!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME9C:0 "Perhaps we should listen, their God seems to help them."
 nhs_religionevents.10.t:0 "Hero amongst Men"
 nhs_religionevents.10.d:0 "War makes men from boys and boys from men. During our ongoing war one of our lesser soldiers fought with such strength and conviction that he is widely regarded as a war hero amongst his fellows. He is but a peasant from a small farming village as far as we know, and no one knows his original name, but the troops have started giving him the name of an ancient hero. It would seem that even our enemies are aware of his reputation, because every time this hero amongst men shows up on the battlefield he instils great fear in the enemy ranks. Such heroic men are a rare occurrence indeed, and should be treated with great respect! Our army advisors suggest giving him a commanding position and acknowledging the name the soldiers have given him."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME10:0 "I wish to meet this Hero at once!"
 nhs_religionevents.51.t:0 "Local Natives observe Ceremony"
 nhs_religionevents.51.d:0 "A native scouting party has observed our settlers during ceremony last night, and were terrified by the displays of smoke, the clothing and the sincere songs. They have returned to their leaders believing we are demons or demon worshippers and the clan is treating us differently since."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME51:0 "Not what we were looking for."
 nhs_religionevents.52.t:0 "People require solid Guidance"
 nhs_religionevents.52.d:0 "Some of our priests have requested an audience today to discuss matters of faith. They feel there is a lack of proper guidance without a decent church structure and that this may cause fractures among our people, especially between those who settled further from the capital. They request funds to organise a new patriarchate for this New World, united under a single patriarch, so any theological debate can be held internally and under the patriarch's supervision rather than unnecessarily burdening the common people with affairs they do not fully grasp. The funds required would be sizeable, but a loyal patriarch often guarantees a loyal people..."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME52A:0 "Fund them, let them reorganise."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME52B:0 "Not right now."
 nhs_religionevents.53.t:0 "The Orthodox Influence"
 nhs_religionevents.53.d:0 "A group of prominent local nobles have come forward to make a request. They have converted to Orthodoxy under the influence of our Elysian neighbours, and claim to have seen the light. They request that we proclaim Orthodoxy as our state religion so we may receive the same blessings as the newcomers from the east. This would bring us closer to the Elysians and their prowess, but would greatly displease our current pagan priesthood and population. On the other hand, displeasing the nobles and the Orthodox population would have an almost equally malicious impact!"
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME53A:0 "Tell me more of these Christians..."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME53B:0 "The ways of our Forefathers must be honoured!"
 nhs_religionevents.54.t:0 "Local Natives bring Sacrifices"
 nhs_religionevents.54.d:0 "After being discovered by the natives and the spread of fear for our unfamiliar and seemingly demonic ways, a clan has decided they should offer us sacrifices to avoid our wrath. The natives ran away in fear before we could even refuse the gift, leaving their sizeable offerings behind. This probably won't help our relations..."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME54:0 "Let them hate us, as long as they fear us!"
 nhs_religionevents.55.t:0 "An uncommon Solution"
 nhs_religionevents.55.d:0 "Proper high class Orthodox citizens from a poorly integrated, pagan province have addressed us in the Senate. They report the natives are unwilling to embrace the true faith and remain oblivious to the evil of their ways. The nobles request the permission to utilise more extreme ways to 'convince' the pagans. Rest assured, the nobles do not do this for their own gain but out of piety, and will thus transfer much of the monetary gains -by sequestering property for example- their method would deliver to the treasury."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME55A:0 "Allow for it."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME55B:0 "Dismiss the offer for now."
 NHSRELIGIONEVENTSNAME55C:0 "Refuse to ever reconsider!"
