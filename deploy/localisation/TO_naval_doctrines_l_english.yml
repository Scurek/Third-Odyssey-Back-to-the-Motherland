 elysian_marines_desc:0 "After their own perilous landing, as well as subsequent landings on islands to the south Elysians have trained to become very skilled at naval assaults, in preparation for the eventual return to their homelands. Sailors learn quickly how best to scout coastlines for places to land, and special marine regiments quickly land to take and hold beachheads for the rest of their forces to follow. These brave and stalwart sailors form the backbone of the Elysian's navies ability to contribute to land based conflict, and are ready and waiting for the announcement of the invasion."
