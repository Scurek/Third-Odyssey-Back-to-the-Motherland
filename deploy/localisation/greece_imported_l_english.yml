 moe_title_of_despot:0 "Title of Despot"
 moe_title_of_despot_desc:0 "The title of Despot was originally conferred on the ruler of Morea by the Emperor, designating him as heir apparent. Though the empire is gone, the importance of the title still stands. Let us use it to legitimize our claims as the rightful heirs to the empire."

 memory_of_epirote_conquests:0 "Memory of Epirote Conquests"
 memory_of_epirote_conquests_desc:0 "Once, Epirus was the mightiest of the successor states.

 crossroads_of_the_adriatic:0 "Crossroads of the Adriatic"
 crossroads_of_the_adriatic_desc:0 "Epirus has always served as a point of cultural diffusion. In ancient times, it was where Greek culture met the Illyrians to the north. In Roman times, it was where Roman culture entered Greece, and Greek Rome. Over the centuries, these lands have seen Normans, Franks, Saracens, Bulgarians, Serbs, Turks and Iberians. Even now, it remains a melting pot, where Greek, Slavic and Italian influences all intersect and converge, and we have always tried to patronize all sides."
