But as our efforts on the isle have borne fruit, remnants of what once was have been gradually revealed from beneath the ice and snow. Now there are rumours abound all across Vinland as to just what our fallen ancestors may have left behind there.\n\nWithin the Halls of the Althing, already the many factions are plying their cases before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], eager to see Greenland ensconced as another Pillar of our nation. Tension is already rising as talk of restoring the colonies, and truly embracing our heritage into our own daily lives, clashes against the insistence that our ancestors should be properly venerated, not simply walked over.

Already our northern kin are being flooded with eager old-worlders, ready to find land or trade or riches. And slowly they are learning of us as well. And the gold we control.\n\nNow more than ever we find ourselves faced with an existential threat. We remember the old world, and the Europeans who never came to Constantinople's aid. Some even helped burn it to the ground. The riches of this new world almost rival those of who we once were at our very peak. And should we let them, they will come for our riches again. We suffered the Fourth Crusade before. We will not suffer another.\n\nAnd yet there are those native to this world, or whose memories do not stretch so far back, who see this instead as an opportunity.

The legions of Rome once conquered the known world - but that was long ago.\n\nA lesser man might quail at these truths, but Ioannes and his brother Konstantinos are not lesser men. While delving into the depths of the Imperial Library for anything that might deliver them from destruction, the brothers located a hidden cache of information left behind by the exalted former emperor: Alexios Komnenos. The cache contained detailed schematics of dromons retrofitted with the deep-sea capabilities of the Ancient Roman vessels that plied the treacherous seas between the coasts of Hispania and the lands of the Celts in ages past, and was intended for a trading expedition to Varangian Vinland that never materialised.

One is to tell the truth to the Portuguese king and inform him that this is not an expedition but us abandoning Constantinople in search of this 'Vinland', with no intention of returning to Europe.\n\nThe other is to lie to [POR.Monarch.GetName]. Let the Portuguese keep the idea that this is merely an expedition and that we intend to return in due time. In the Vinlandic records, we also found a map that leads to a place called 'Greenland', a land of nothing but ice. If we give them this map and tell them that this is our destination, pretending it is Vinland, then should the Portuguese follow after us, they'll find nothing.

 nhs_hellenicconversion.1.d:0 "Georgios Gemistos Plethon was a brilliant mind, held in high esteem by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], as well as his brother and father. He circulated Plato's teachings to the barbarous West, and gave the Latins some small measure of enlightenment. For this, as well as his friendship with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - and his advanced age: he was born in 1355! - he was brought along with the fleet of exiles. Now, however, we have seen his true colors: he is worse than a heretic or a heathen: he is an apostate, one who has turned his back on God. He sings hymns to Zeus and other pagan deities, and teaches the mysticism of Zoroaster, and his intelligence and charisma is such that even a Cardinal, Bessarion - who also made his way onto the fleet - has fallen under his sway. With such an influential and high-ranking backer, Plethon's ideas have begun infecting the lower classes, and even some of the rural farmers and woodsmen who ranged inland when the fleet landed. Perhaps his worst crime, however, is that he repudiates the Romanness of our people, declaring them solely to be pagan Hellenes instead of righteous Romans.\n\nThis apostate Neoplatonist is popular enough - and held in high enough imperial esteem - to where arresting him would be unwise.

This has made the hearts of men wander far from homes they never knew, and gravitate to the hearths they grew up in.\n\nWhat do men who have known nothing beyond Elysium care for the name 'Roman', which has been perverted by every institution in Europe? What do men who grew up in the verdant hills and shores of the west care for the decaying east, so full of strife? The men who call themselves 'Elysian' rather than 'Roman' do not care at all for the corpse of an empire left behind. Better to cultivate this green and pleasant land, they say, than go back to the land across the sea our ancestors were driven out of at the tip of a sword. Or perhaps even venture to shores even farther west - this time as conquerors, not as refugees.\n\nOf course, there are many who rail against this. Some men have pride in their heritage, some have vengeance burning in their hearts, and some see it as their duty, as the last of the Romans, to return to their ancestral homeland and put it to rights.

The procession is set to tour the empire, solidifying authority and quelling potential dissent.\n\nAs the role of the sword gives way to the power of diplomacy, we must now navigate the desires of our newly acquired subjects. They have called rather pretentiously for the existing Frankish bureaucracy to be kept mostly as it is, and for the former imperial lands to be reintegrated into it once recovered. Adhering to their pleas would certainly strengthen our legitimacy in their eyes. Many of the Emperor's advisors however, suggest focusing on integrating the princedoms into the larger Imperial structure, thus disregarding any notion of de jure Holy Roman lands altogether.

 nhs2_mainlandevents.42.da:0 "In 1195, Isaakios Angelos was deposed from the Purple by his brother Alexios. Eight years later, the son of Isaakios - also named Alexios - would court disaster by promising the Venetian-backed knights of the Fourth Crusade extravagant gifts and exorbitant bribes in return for restoring his father to the throne. The perfidious Venetians, not content with placing their puppet on the throne in 1203, kept their army encamped and grew bolder and bolder. Finally they sacked the Queen of Cities in 1204, dividing the Roman Empire in half with their 'Partitio Romaniæ,' which saw all the lands from the Golden Horn to the Ionian Sea shorn from the empire. In addition, many priceless artifacts were looted and stolen and taken to Venice itself, while the masterminds of that treachery died fat and happy after long lives. Now the tables are turned: [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers are marching into Venice and some isolated looting has already begun. Some of the officers are advising reigning in the troops and showing mercy, claiming that Venice is a strategically important city located on the nexus of roads leading from Italy to the Balkans, and also controls the Adriatic trading routes - and also that a sacking of Venice would turn the great courts of Europe against our realm. One general has pushed back at this talk, claiming that the great courts of Europe have always hated us ever since the days of Charlemagne, and that we might as well give them a valid reason to be displeased. 'Put the entire city to the sword, for Venice has been the downfall of our empire,' he says.\n\nIn any event, we should send the Turks a gift of thanks for destroying the tomb of Enrico Dandolo, who was buried in the Hagia Sophia."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.42.db:0 "In 1203, the struggling Venetian-backed Frankish crusaders accepted an offer from the son of deposed emperor Isaakios II begging the crusader army to intervene and place the man back on the throne; in recompense, he would use the vast wealth of the Roman Empire to speed the crusaders safely to the Holy Land. This promise went unfulfilled. Alexios IV and Isaakios II acted in good faith, but the empire was too poor from the disastrous mismanagement of the Angeloi to pay for the transportation of the crusader knights. The Venetians, who bankrolled the crusader knights at a very low cost, knew they were losing money from a failed investment, but were loathe to turn on a man dealing with them in good faith, and knew better than to try to wring blood from a stone. Alexios V Doukas Mourtzouphlos, on the other hand, had Alexios IV Angelos executed, offered battle several times with the Latins, and finally had all Latins expelled from Konstantinoupolis. This was the final straw: the Venetians and their Frankish allies could either take the city or starve to death in the heart of hostile territory. And if they had to crush a rotten apple to do it, they wouldn't think twice.\n\n...or at least such has been the narrative pushed by influential Venetian merchants in the early years of the exile. This narrative, which paints the Venetians as, if not blameless, at least understandable and not outright villains - and furthermore paints the Romans as the ironic authors of their own demise - has taken root in the [Root.GetAdjective] psyche. The Fourth Crusade, once seen as western intolerance and perfidy, has transformed into an ironic tale of hubristic downfall. Thus, while the army marches into Venice, there is no grand sack, no burning the city down to the foundations in misplaced vengeance. Some looting has erupted, but the generals are urging caution and restraint in the troops."

Daring skirmishes on the frontier by him and his Janissaries have earned him the respect, if not admiration, of most of the Emperor's court, and now he appears before [Root.Monarch.GetName] once again with a proposal. He seeks to establish a new Janissary regiment, perhaps several, by recruiting from the young Barbaroi, especially those who have been orphaned in the previous conflicts. These recruits would be educated in the Greek language, instilled with the True Faith, and subjected to rigorous discipline akin to the Janissaries who were once deployed against us.\n\nWhile the proposal is in itself pragmatic, many are worried that this would alienate the local populace from us, without whom we cannot hope to thrive while stranded here. Others point out the expense, which could be better used on expanding our existing militia. However, the prevailing sentiment seems to stem from a simple and singular aversion rooted in our past experiences at the hands of such troops."

But as our army grows in size, some argue that maintaining such division in armed forces serves no purpose, and that there is no place in a modern [Root.GetAdjective] army for such a Turkish implement. On the other hand the Prinkipes are incredibly effective, if somewhat expensive to replace, and would certainly serve the throne well in centuries to come."

Over time, these regiments, dubbed the Prinkipes by our people as a tribute to the prince, have more than proven themselves defending the frontier towns. With the recent reforms, however, we can no longer tolerate the existence of such independent armed forces within our territory, no matter how well intended.

The Elysian Orthodoxy, as many have begun calling it, hailing from the Greek holdings in the New World, has not only weathered the tumultuous waves of the Atlantic but has victoriously established itself against the staunch resistance of the myriad forces in the Old World. Now, fervent preachers, likely sponsored by the Greeks themselves, traverse our dominions, weaving the vibrant tapestry of the Elysian teachings.\n\nEven some within our court, inspired by the Greeks' success and envisioning the Elysian Gospel as a unifying force, advocate for embracing this newfound faith. They argue for the potential of religious harmony, a departure from the strife that has often characterized our lands. Yet, as the Elysian influence expands, others voice concern.

 nhs_mission_events.23.d:0 "Governing an empire that spans two continents, each half separated by three thousand miles of vast ocean, is no small feat. It must be accounted for that any dispatch from one frontier to the other must take at least two months just to account for the travel time. Tax collection becomes nigh-impossible as the gold and silver mined in Elysium must either be minted locally or be carried across the Atlantic on great treasure convoys. Mustering armies from every province in the empire is a downright-Herculean task, as any army would eat through the local supply within weeks and campaigns must be planned months, sometimes years, in advance.\n\n'Why not name a viceroy?' asks an ambitious, yet talented, cousin of the ruling [Root.GetElyEmperorTitle] one day. 'A man who can govern the western holdings in your name, as the Palaiologoi based in Thrace used to do for the disconnected Morean holdings?'\n\nThe idea is not without merit, [Root.Monarch.GetName] concedes. But the risk of rebellion - of such a viceroy declaring himself independent, or - [Root.GetGodGods] forbid, the true emperor - would be ever-present. If such a risk is deemed worth it, the benefits a decentralized administration would bring such a far-flung holding are many: the people would rejoice at no longer being ruled from a city thousands of miles away from them; the tax collection would be infinitely less complicated; hostile raids could be responded to - and army musterings be carried out - in a more timely fashion; and other such benefits.\n\nBut is it worth it?."

The Greeks in our empire demand their conversion, their expulsion, that they stop speaking Turkish, and all manner of contradictory things that can all be summed up in the phrase 'I don't want to live next to Turks.'

Indeed, they have served the empire well, and they are often more loyal and competent than the Romans. Perhaps the process could be repeated on a larger scale with these Romanized, Christianized Turks - who are generally called 'Mourtatoi,' from an Arabic word meaning 'Apostate' - leading their wayward brethren into loyalty."

 nhs_mission_events.51.d:0 "It has always been the story of a city, and the dream that inspired it. If Roma was the embodiment of ambition, Constantinople was of determination. Determination to endure, to survive, to preserve what little remained in this ever changing, hostile world. The same that fuelled long-gone emperors and the fearless peoples that followed them across the horizon, through treacherous seas and hidden lands.\n\nAs brave explorers and battered refugees landed in mysterious coasts, a new city, a new dream, was born. One of survival, one of renewal. In Nea Konstantinoupolis, refuge was offered from above in the form of Elysium, sheltering the lost sons of an empire thought lost by all. The city: a lonely candle surrounded by darkness, and last remains of the light that once was.\n\nWhat now many think as ineludible and predestined, was never so. For centuries, every baker, bureaucrat, merchant, soldier, brother and sister, kept Nea Konstantinoupolis alive. From inside the walls or out in the provinces, every citizen knew what was at stake by keeping the last light from burning out. For only time, and that ancient, inherited determination, would let it shine as bright as before. Perhaps even more.\n\nFrom then on, they marched home. Through perilous seas, pretenders, and conquerors, the old banner landed on Constantinople. As one city embraced the other, so did their dreams: Restoration. Italia, the cradle of it all, awaited. Roma was next.\n\nWith Europe and beyond waking up from their long stupor, we do so too. We wake up to see an empire restored, no longer a dream. Kings and princes bow before us, accepting -by reason or force- our solemn, supreme authority upon the world. Through blood, loss, strength, and glory, we have prevailed. The long night is over. Dawn is here. \n\nThe story of three cities is now one. A so, new chapter begins.\n\nWe made our cities the world, and the world, our city. Rome.\n                                                                                                  - Leandros Epipleon,\n                                                                                                   Imperial Chronicler"

 nhs_mission_events.52.d:0 "Elysia, illustrious, unique Elysia. From beyond the seas you stand proud, unrivalled. Even your very origins are noble: Way back to Aeneas escaping from a burning Troy and his descendants founding Rome, to the original empire standing strong until old Roma was overtaken by Constantinople, whose walls would hold out the inevitable for a thousand years. Such is the mantle you carry, the responsibility that rests upon your shoulders. \n\nUnlike our forefathers, the land we call home has a much more recent history, though at first glance it had belonged to us for centuries: the cities that dot the coasts, our paved roads, forts and, of course, the palaces and churches that populate our capital. Once nothing but a refugee camp, now rises as a shining beacon of culture, wealth, and -of course- power. Armies march to the sound of chants and music, architects design and engineers build marvels that wonder every foreigner whose sight are set upon, and on top of it all, our green-gold flag flies proud under the Atlantic winds. Has someone seen a civilization that has managed so much in so little time? Some say that we, Elysians, are way too ambitious. But what better field to grow ambition than heaven-delivered Elysium? \n\nIt is from burgeoning [950.GetName] that the world knows, fears, and respect us. Ships come and go in the name of wealth and dominance. The magnificent city of Prosphorion, our great port and door to Nea Konstantinoupolis, is just the first step towards the greater Elysian dominium. Europe, the so-called ‘Old World’, is nothing but an extension of our manifested destiny. Where not so long-ago small kingdoms and nations squabbled over the ruins of our forefathers, now order and peace has been re-established. Even Africa and the dilapidated Levant now bask in the prosperity provided by Elysian arms and law. \n\nSome dare to compare us to Roma and the old empire.

Although ordinarily this may have been a threat, his relatively minor status in court has kept the retinue from growing too large. \n\nNow however, Belisarios has made his intentions clear. He has come to the council of [Root.Monarch.GetName] for support in an expedition to lands beyond the Kyklades.

The matted grasslands, however, have proven difficult to construct on - however, our settlement of the Tanoan province further west provides the new settlers with heavy stone, which serves as a better foundation. \n\nEven more curiously, the tribes are quite agreeable and have moved in to our colonial towns.

One particularly harrowing tale is that of a temple in eastern Tayshia which was beset by raiders. The garrison killed nearly three times their number before the natives pulled back - and burned the temple to the ground. Having had enough, a prominent Apogonoi in the region assembled the various garrisons, militias, and some veteran soldiers into what he calls the Lone Star Legion. \n\nThis Legion is unusual in many ways. It was never cleared for formation by Neo Sparta for one, and its recruitment standards are rather slack. However, unlike the other legions the Lone Star Legion's primary objectives are defence of Tayshia and, by extension, Lakonia as a whole from the Skythians. This is accomplished by armed patrols along major trade routes, effective training of garrisons, and so-called Rangers touring the boundary between Spartan settlements and native lands. This means that the new Legion is quite stationary and not up to the standards of the rest of our army. However, their effectiveness against raiders has earned them a lot of popularity among the settlers."

Since the land is not nearly as rough as that of Arkadia Minor, we can expect more development to take place here in the future. The nearby bay, which the natives call Maaraiwo, in particular provides a ring around which major settlements could be built and linked to the rest of Sparta, or perhaps the Kyklades themselves."

 msg_mission.10.d:0 "Our timid settlement of the Kyklades was motivated by one main concern: the so called Roman navy. Lakonia proper has a dearth of harbours both natural and man-made, and very little expertise in shipbuilding. Thus, settlement in the Kyklades would provide us with the shorelines necessary to construct more harbours, with which to build a navy that could compete with the Roman navy. \n\nThis idea has really taken with the settlers of Gythion, whom are mostly shipwrights experienced in constructing fishing vessels. A harbour is already under construction in Gythion, with optimistic new plans for a grand Spartan navy, based in the new province. This is obviously a few years away, but it's good to see that there is now some enthusiasm in the idea."

The Haudenosaunee King declares himself humbly the Great Peacemaker.\n\nThe Great Peacemaker's ambassador presents himself before the Roman court. He is a chimera of customs, wearing a Norseman beard, Roman silks, a curved oriental scabbard hangs empty at his waist. His face is painted for war, some whispers declare, that he comes to pronounce the supremacy of his woodland ruler. Others whisper that his face is painted for peace and he searches for a way of reconciliation with the Roman crown. But he comes bearing neither war nor peace, but a chicken.\n\nFrom a velvet bag, the ambassador presents the court with a noble chicken of black and white mottled feathers.

They are also lacking in numbers for the moment with only as many souls as they could pack onto their large rafts, and so our people’s help could be of great worth to them.\n\nThere was some degree of agreement from these Romans, but not much. They seemed to find our offers and assistance only a matter of light entertainment. They accepted an alliance with us, to help us in our feuds and for us to help them in turn, but their word is no more binding than the sun is bound to the sky.

And while the Great Peacemaker has taught us that peace is always a noble goal and can bring great strength to those who properly cultivate it, our centuries of conflict have taught us that such insults must be repaid in blood. It is always a good and noble thing to offer hands in help to others, but to do so without thought or restraint is suicidal. We gave the Romans their one chance, and they have rebuked us.
