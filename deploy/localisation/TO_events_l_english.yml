They do not speak Portuguese, but greet us in heavily accented Greek, asking if they have arrived in Elysium.\n\nIt would seem that the secret of our survival is finally out, undoubtedly slipped from loose lips in a tavern or brothel in far Lisbon, where men do so seldom watch what they say. And now the very first of the newcomers has arrived, eager to find in us the same wealth our allies in Iberia have no doubt acquired from the exotic goods only we could have possibly provided them. Already they speak of their own deals, and some merchants have been quick to head towards the docks with their own goods to get a jump ahead of the curve in dealing with these foreigners.\n\nThis is the end of our silence and controlled isolation from the old world. Now we must be prepared to face the entirety of Europe flocking to our shores. There will be great danger in this. Ships bearing cannons instead of ballistae may could well destroy our ports if they find us unwilling to give them what they want. But we are not afraid. We are Romans, blessed with the Land of Elysium, a Paradise once reserved for those who died with the favour of the Greek Gods.\n\nAnd with risk, comes opportunity."

What few spies we have managed to place in far flung Europe already report great fleets of colonists being prepared in dozens of ports across the Atlantic coastline, and soon we may well face a flood not just of tradable goods, but of people too, all looking to our paradise, our Elysia, with envy and desire.\n\nWe will need to be ready to defend our new lands, or we may soon find ourselves displaced and overrun like the barbaroi before us."

To the west lie the Serbs and Hungarians, eager to carve up the pieces of a dying empire and expand their own dominion. The Varna Crusaders have been butchered. The legions of Rome once conquered the known world - but that was long ago.\n\nA lesser man might quail at these truths, but Ioannes and his brother Konstantinos are not lesser men. While delving into the depths of the Imperial Library for anything that might deliver them from destruction, the brothers located a hidden cache of information left behind by the exalted former emperor: Alexios Komnenos. The cache contained detailed schematics of dromons retrofitted with the deep-sea capabilities of the Ancient Roman vessels that plied the treacherous seas between the coasts of Hispania and the lands of the Celts in ages past, and was intended for a trading expedition to Varangian Vinland that never materialized. With them, the two brothers were able to scheme up a plan to hastily retrofit the remnants of the Imperial Navy to the designs, reinforced with modern construction techniques, and flee west in a new Odyssey, just as Aeneas fled Troy three thousand years ago."

Even now the last defenders of the empire must be making some doomed last stand at the Hagia Sophia, swords flashing in fearless defiance of their fate for an hour longer until they are overcome. Mehmed must be smiling as he gives the order to loot the Queen of Cities and sell those men and women left behind to a life of slavery.\n\nStrange barbarian men on the beach have fled at our approach, but we have bigger concerns than finding a few men who evidently have no plans to attack us.

 nhs_hellenicconversion1.d:0 "Georgios Gemistos Plethon was a brilliant mind, held in high esteem by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], as well as his brother and father. He circulated Plato's teachings to the barbarous West, and gave the Latins some small measure of enlightenment. For this, as well as his friendship with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - and his advanced age: he was born in 1355! - he was brought along with the fleet of exiles. Now, however, we have seen his true colors: he is worse than a heretic or a heathen: he is an apostate, one who has turned his back on God. He sings hymns to Zeus and other pagan deities, and teaches the mysticism of Zoroaster, and his intelligence and charisma is such that even a Cardinal, Bessarion - who also made his way onto the fleet - has fallen under his sway. With such an influential and high-ranking backer, Plethon's ideas have begun infecting the lower classes, and even some of the rural farmers and woodsmen who ranged inland when the fleet landed. Perhaps his worst crime, however, is that he repudiates the Romanness of our people, declaring them solely to be pagan Hellenes instead of righteous Romans.\n\nThis apostate Neoplatonist is popular enough - and held in high enough imperial esteem - to where arresting him would be unwise. In addition, he's sure to die anyway within a few years of natural causes and his extreme age. But he is still dangerous and should be watched."

The church has made it clear that this is an outrage and if we do not act now it will only embolden the Plethonist riff raff.

'A man who can govern the western holdings in your name, as the Palaiologoi based in Thrace used to do for the disconnected Morean holdings?'\n\nThe idea is not without merit, [Root.Monarch.GetName] concedes. But the risk of rebellion - of such a viceroy declaring himself independent, or - [Root.GetGodGods] forbid, the true emperor - would be ever-present. If such a risk is deemed worth it, the benefits a decentralized administration would bring such a far-flung holding are many: the people would rejoice at no longer being ruled from a city thousands of miles away from them; the tax collection would be infinitely less complicated; hostile raids could be responded to - and army musterings be carried out - in a more timely fashion; and other such benefits.\n\nBut is it worth it?."

 nhs_mission_events.50.db:0 "With the reconquest of most of Anatolia - the ancient heartland of the empire - there has been an increased demand by our Greek-speaking subjects to 'do something' about the Turks who live in Anatolia - who call themselves 'Rumites' to hearken back to the old Sultanate of Rum. The Greeks in our empire demand their conversion, their expulsion, that they stop speaking Turkish, and all manner of contradictory things that can all be summed up in the phrase 'I don't want to live next to Turks.' Whether the Turks stop being Turks or stop living in Anatolia is immaterial to them. Many of our advisors have been swept up in the wave of anti-Turkish sentiment, and are advocating the expulsion of the Rumites.\n\nThe descendants of Prince Orhan and his Turkish lieutenants, however, have cautioned us against following our Greek advisors' course of action. They point to themselves - mostly Romanized, but still with recognizably Turkish heritage - as a model. 'We were Turks once,' they claim, 'but now the passage of time has made us Roman.' Indeed, they have served the empire well, and they are often more loyal and competent than the Romans. Perhaps the process could be repeated on a larger scale with these Romanized, Christianized Turks - who are generally called 'Mourtatoi,' from an Arabic word meaning 'Apostate' - leading their wayward brethren into loyalty."

Although ordinarily this may have been a threat, his relatively minor status in court has kept the retinue from growing too large. \n\n Now however, Belisarios has made his intentions clear. He has come to the council of [Root.Monarch.GetName] for support in an expedition to lands beyond the Kyklades.

The garrison killed nearly three times their number before the natives pulled back - and burned the temple to the ground. Having had enough, a prominent Apogonoi in the region assembled the various garrisons, militias, and some veteran soldiers into what he calls the Lone Star Legion. \n\nThis Legion is unusual in many ways. It was never cleared for formation by Neo Sparta for one, and its recruitment standards are rather slack. However, unlike the other legions the Lone Star Legion's primary objectives are defence of Tayshia and, by extension, Lakonia as a whole from the Skythians. This is accomplished by armed patrols along major trade routes, effective training of garrisons, and so-called Rangers touring the boundary between Spartan settlements and native lands. This means that the new Legion is quite stationary and not up to the standards of the rest of our army.

Since the land is not nearly as rough as that of Arkadia Minor, we can expect more development to take place here in the future. The nearby bay, which the natives call Maaraiwo, in particular provides a ring around which major settlements could be built and linked to the rest of Sparta, or perhaps the Kyklades themselves."

Lakonia proper has a dearth of harbours both natural and man-made, and very little expertise in shipbuilding. Thus, settlement in the Kyklades would provide us with the shorelines necessary to construct more harbours, with which to build a navy that could compete with the Roman navy. \n\nThis idea has really taken with the settlers of Gythion, whom are mostly shipwrights experienced in constructing fishing vessels. A harbour is already under construction in Gythion, with optimistic new plans for a grand Spartan navy, based in the new province. This is obviously a few years away, but it's good to see that there is now some enthusiasm in the idea."

The people, frightened by this strange event, hurried to find shelter, and there upon they arrived at the home of a woman. Jigonhsasee, ally of the Peacemaker, was what she introduced herself as. As people from all the many clans arrived she welcomed all at her hearth, offering food and good council, and ensuring none struck against each other.\n\nFinally the day came where The Peacemaker arrived to speak again his vision of a single united commonwealth, where killing would be replaced by thinking, and all would be united as a single family. And as he continued to speak, all listened well for they knew that history was taking place before them. They listened now to a Great Man.\n\nHis teaching, the laws he wished to build for all to live beneath, we called the Great Law of Peace. And at the lakeside he planted a Tree of Peace, proclaiming that its roots should spread in all directions, any nation that wished to join in their peace need only follow those roots back to their source and take shelter beneath its branches. \n\nFive Nations had there been there that day. Five nations there were still when down the sun set. But what was there now, that was not before, was a Family."

And while the Great Peacemaker has taught us that peace is always a noble goal and can bring great strength to those who properly cultivate it, our centuries of conflict have taught us that such insults must be repaid in blood. It is always a good and noble thing to offer hands in help to others, but to do so without thought or restraint is suicidal. We gave the Romans their one chance, and they have rebuked us.
