Now there are rumours abound all across Vinland as to just what our fallen ancestors may have left behind there.\n\nWithin the Halls of the Althing, already the many factions are plying their cases before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], eager to see Greenland ensconsed as another Pillar of our nation. Tension is already rising as talk of restoring the colonies, and truly embracing our heritage into our own daily lives, clashes against the insistence that our ancestors should be properly venerated, not simply walked over. But ultimately the choice must rest on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s decision."

Several chiefs, warriors and other officials from these subsumed natives have formed their own small councils, and now seek audience with us as both a subject and independent group.\n\nThe way these Barbaroi describe themselves, they accept our rule and our laws, but demand the right to govern themselves in turn. They shall listen and obey, and assist in dealing with others of their kind and in return we shall respect their right to their religion, we shall allow them to live as autonomous communes within our empire.\n\nTheir greatest demand is that we agree to leave their ancestral lands untouched, left to them and their people and to not set foot upon them without permission. In some cases these lands are easily given, but in others they are some of the lands with the most potential benefit to us in the long term and just ignoring them would be to waste resources for the sake of sparing the feelings of a few barbaroi.\n\nWe can easily accept everything else, even if this unorthodox relationship is not pleasing to us.

A few months later a pigeon found its way back, carrying the last message ever received from the Roman bloodline: a letter of warning.

Maybe they have been blind for the Ottoman power with our protection, or maybe their ambition will pay off, but either way we no longer have direct control of the peninsula.

A few months later a pigeon found its way back, carrying two messages. The first, addressed to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, states that the Byzantines were able to survive a great storm despite heavy losses and that they had spotted flocks of seabirds, a sure sign that land is nearby. The second is a fabricated account of their voyage addressed to the nations of Europe, informing them that the Byzantines had perished in a series of giant storms and endless ocean.

After setting up basic shelters we held a grand meeting and decided that we'd elect a new leader every few years or when the previous one has died.

To the east lie the lands of the hostile Turks, successors to the Arabs that battered Anatolia in times long past. To the west lie the Serbs and Hungarians, eager to carve up the pieces of a dying empire and expand their own dominion. The Varna Crusaders have been butchered. The legions of Rome once conquered the known world - but that was long ago. A lesser man might quail at these truths, but Ioannes and his brother Konstantinos are not lesser men. While delving into the depths of the Imperial Library for anything that might deliver them from destruction, the brothers located a hidden cache of information left behind by the exalted former emperor: Alexios Komnenos. The cache contained detailed schematics of dromons retrofitted with the deep-sea capabilities of the Ancient Roman vessels that plied the treacherous seas between the coasts of Hispania and the lands of the Celts in ages past, and was intended for a trading expedition to Varangian Vinland that never materialized. With them, the two brothers were able to scheme up a plan to hastily retrofit the remnants of the Imperial Navy to the designs, reinforced with modern construction techniques, and flee west in a new Odyssey, just as Aeneas fled Troy three thousand years ago."

In addition, a skilled German engineer named Johannes Grandt was able to recreate Greek Fire on a limited scale based on scrolls stored in a hidden cache in the imperial library, and is requesting that space on the fleet be allotted to storing the substance and the ingredients used to make it.

Silk, he says, has long been the garment of royalty and empire, and would make a fine luxury trade good as well.

 nhs_hellenicconversion1.d:0 "Georgios Gemistos Plethon was one of the few brilliant minds we could not afford to leave behind as we turned our back on our homeland. A gifted philosopher and scholar, his contributions had not gone unnoticed by our late Basileus, something which allowed him the opportunity of safe passage to these new strange lands we have come to call home. In his waning years however it has come clear that Pletho holds some controversial if not outright heretical beliefs. Alarmingly he appears to recognise this and has publicly challenged members of our clergy as well as members of the royal family to debate him. While we cannot at the moment afford to expand the energy to rid ourselves of this man nor could we risk losing such a reliable advisor the following years will surely tell us if we were right in letting this heathen board our ships."

But through it all he had always been fiercely loyal to the Roman family and throne. His passing sent shockwaves throughout Elysia and caught many of us off-guard. Regardless of our own feelings towards the man we are conscious of the tremendous loss. Nonetheless we are confronted yet again by a difficult choice. In light of the circumstance, a state funeral - which should be the obvious choice -  would be controversial.

Representatives of this 'Ekklesia' have reached our court, and demanded an audience with the $MONARCHTITLE$. To their credit they presented their full support to our $MONARCHTITLE$, and re-affirmed their loyalty to Elysia. However they have made several demands as well. Mostly, their reclamations are focused on a recognition of autonomy and self-governance. \n \nWhile not necessarily outlandish, these demands do cause the risk of establishing a precedent in our nation. One one hand allowing a measure of autonomy and protection to the Neo-Pagans would certainly appease them and lessen the risk of an armed revolt. On the other they could see this gesture as one of approval and encouragement instead of pacification. Church authorities have argued that we should arrest these heretics without a second thought, even if this will certainly bring about an armed revolt."

In the New World, the barbarians outnumbered us by a significant margin, and our attempts at Romanisation were only partially successful. Spurred on by the influence of their councils, some of the outlying, partially-Romanised barbarians took to calling themselves 'Symmachoi', our allies, as opposed to our subjects, though there was no real difference in terms of governance. The more integrated barbarians, meanwhile, dropped all previous tribal affiliations and took to the name 'Elysian', after our new home.  Many of the lowest classes in our realm, with no great loyalty to our grand and ancient traditions, took up this new fashion, and each year more and more Romans made the switch, especially young rural Romans.  The aristocracy held to the old traditions of Romanitas for longer, but all too soon the day came in which our people finally shed their long-held Roman identity and instead called themselves Elysians."

Closest to this are the coastal provinces, in heavy contact with the capital through constant trade and transport. They are referred to as Elyshians, with a 'shi', because of the rough pronunciation of the 's' that probably became popular among sailors to be better understood at sea where the waves and wind make conversation on deck difficult. The inland has been become known as home of the Elyric, those closest to the natives and with the highest adoption of their language.

Such a demand would obviously be reciprocated: just as the Portuguese would not be able to form colonies in the Elysian continent, neither would we be able to form our own colonies in the south, which our cartographers have named Arkadia; thus, the New World would be divided between the [Root.GetElysiansRomans] and Portuguese, north and south.

Indeed, our alchemists and engineers have plans to improve the range and reliability of both ship mounted and handheld variants using more modern techniques and materials. However, they regretfully inform us that our supply of naphtha, a viscous black liquid critical to the production of Greek Fire, is running low; forcing us to ration our supply to one project over the other."

The garrison killed nearly three times their number before the natives pulled back - and burned the temple to the ground. Having had enough, a prominent Apogonoi in the region assembled the various garrisons, militias, and some veteran soldiers into what he calls the Lone Star Legion. \n\nThis Legion is unusual in many ways. It was never cleared for formation by Neo Sparta for one, and its recruitment standards are rather slack. However, unlike the other legions the Lone Star Legion's primary objectives are defence of Tayshia and, by extension, Lakonia as a whole from the Skythians. This is accomplished by armed patrols along major trade routes, effective training of garrisons, and so-called Rangers touring the boundary between Spartan settlements and native lands. This means that the new Legion is quite stationary and not up to the standards of the rest of our army.

Thus, settlement in the Kyklades would provide us with the shorelines necessary to construct more harbours, with which to build a navy that could compete with the Elysian navy. \n\nThis idea has really taken with the settlers of Gythion, whom are mostly shipwrights experienced in constructing fishing vessels. A harbour is already under construction in Gythion, with optimistic new plans for a grand Spartan navy, based in the new province. This is obviously a few years away, but it's good to see that there is now some enthusiasm in the idea."

To prove his purity and spirituality, he would climb to the very top of a tree just beside the falls, where upon our warriors were to cut the tree down. The entire clan gathered to watch as he vanished over the falls, disappearing into the rapids below where he would surely die, either from the fall or from being drowned in the swirling vortex below.\n\nThe next day we awoke to find him seated at the campfire alive and well.

And as he continued to speak, all listened well for they knew that history was taking place before them. They listened now to a Great Man.\n\nHis teaching, the laws he wished to build for all to live beneath, we called the Great Law of Peace.

Nonetheless, through contact with traders and by employing Hellenised natives, they came into contact with and have already integrated some of our language into their own. We will also fund local events that are Elysian in origin as well as their own, hoping they adopt some of our customs as well.

 nhs_vov_coloniesevents.1.d:0 "It has been a harsh life as a Viking. When Leif Erikson made the grand crossing and founded our colonies, he found a land harsh and cold and filled with skraelings eager to shed our blood upon their heathen shores in the name of a thousand heathen gods.\nBut we adapted. We are warriors, strong enough to sail the great Sea of Worms and arrive here in this land where none of the old world dare to go. We spread. Our people taking this land for their own and well and truly becoming a Jarldom to be feared. There was even talk of returning to Iceland and Norway, taking our great glory and enforcing our will on those lesser Vikings who would rather sip of mother's milk than tame the mighty seas.\n\nBut we grew arrogant. We overstepped. We became undone. Disease robbed us of our sister settlements on Greenland and in so doing cut off our communication with the world of old. This disease spread to our lands, inflicting our people and ravaging them. Even worse, we had angered many Skraeling tribes in our path to dominance, and they were more than willing to pounce upon our moment of weakness to cut us down. Thralls rose up, slaying their masters in their beds and stealing their weapons to join in a revolution as we were forced back to the v ery beaches upon which our great ancestor made his first landing.We feared then that we would be thrown back into the sea, to sail the Sea of Worms with no supplies but what fish we could catch on the way.\n\nBut a miracle came. A Jarl who fought with the strength of a dozen Berserkers, and blessed of Odin's all knowing wisdom. We lured the Micmaq into a trap upon their land of Umana'ki. They attacked where they thought us weak, and instead they found us strong. And with one mighty battle we turned back the pursuers and broke them against our shields, before our axes found their soft skin.\n\nNow he lies dead. A knife in the back in the dark. And our people split, brother against brother, as all point fingers at who could be the foul traitor who slew the greatest hope our people have had in many years. There is a uneasy peace for now, but there is only a matter of time before war erupts between our peoples. And for every one of us, there are a thousand Skraelings waiting to descend upon us once again."

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC8:0 "One of the large European ships wrecked itself on a small island off the coast. Unfortunately, there appear to be no survivors, but the cargo seems relatively intact."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA8:0 "Order our shipwrights to study the vessel"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTB8:0 "Have our generals look at the armoury"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME10:0 "Viking of the Caribbean"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC10:0 "Sire, we've had an interesting development. A notorious pirate from Vinland widely known as Firebeard has been terrorizing the Caribbean for years, and by a stroke of luck, we've recently captured the scoundrel. We could simply execute him and and seize the ill-gotten goods, but he's offering his expertise as a captain in exchange for a pardon. However, recruiting a known criminal would greatly tarnish our reputation."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA10:0 "No! Put his head on a pike!"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTB10:0 "He'll serve us well"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME13:0 "The Seeress"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC13:0 "The old holy woman casts the bones against the wall, studying them as they tumble to the floor. When the white shapes finally settle, she studies them for a moment, then turns to you and whispers."

 flavor_vov.EVTOPTC13:0 "'Halfdan.'"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTD13:0 "'Sigurd.'"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME16:0 "The Red Raven Laws"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC16:0 "Unlike Iceland, Vinland still heavily relies on the incredibly influential position of lawspeaker to decide important legal matters. However, these very same lawspeakers are often obstinate to any proposed reforms. If our wise ruler actually commissioned to have our legal traditions written down, it would neuter the lawspeakers' political power for good, but such a breach of tradition would not be popular..."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA16:0 "Send these books to every corner of Vinland!"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTB16:0 "Who am I to question the old ways?"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME22:0 "Brutal Satire"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC22:0 "'Are we Norse, or mice?'\n\n 'Rats!'\n\nA comedy has emerged in theatres across the country. Ostensibly about Leif Eiriksson's discovery of Vinland, the explorer is portrayed as a bumbling oaf and obvious stand-in for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Our people find it hilarious."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA22:0 "Ban the play"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTB22:0 "Ignore the play"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTC22:0 "I love the scene with the talking duck!"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME24:0 "Modernization"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC24:0 "As regular contact with Europe has resumed, we are shocked to discover how primitive we are in comparison. If we're to reach the same levels as other Western nations, a costly modernization program will have to be implemented. "
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA24:0 "Progress marches onward"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME27:0 "The Last Greenlander"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC27:0 "Expeditions to Greenland have only yielded stories of a desolate land filled with hostile natives. However, the most recent band of explorers have come upon the Hvalsey Church, a once-Christian temple now inhabited by a wise hermit, likely the only Norseman left on the entire island. They're not sure what to do with him."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA27:0 "Let him meditate in peace"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTB27:0 "Bring him home so he may spread word of the All-father"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME43:0 "The Great Port"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC43:0 "As Vinland's navy grows, it has become very apparent that the country's current naval infrastructure is woefully inadequate to provide the necessary supplies and repairs. To remedy this, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has commissioned the design of the Mekilt Hufr, the Great Port, to serve as the heart of Vinland's supply chain. Practically a small city, the plans call for the massive port to be built either on the southern side of Flake Eylja or on the great city of Vinóss."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA43:0 "Build it on the island!"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTB43:0 "Build it on the estuary!"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTC43:0 "No, this is far too costly"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME45:0 "Agricultural Revolution of Vinland"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC45:0 "New farming techniques have made their way to Vinland, greatly boosting crop yields. As a result, we have experienced a significant population boom, and many are seeking a less crowded life elsewhere in North America."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA45:0 "Go West!"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME47:0 "The War of the Lakes"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC47:0 "We are now at war with the Huron, a mighty Confederacy of the Bear, Rock, Canoes, and Barking Dog tribes. As much of the war was fought close to and around the five Great Lakes, the conflict would later become known as the War of the Lakes."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA47:0 "The Great Waterfall will be ours!"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME50:0 "The Lost Runestone"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC50:0 "A man bursts into your court, breathing heavily and begging you to follow him. You decide to humor him, following him (with your guards, of course) down the coastline to small grass clearing. There, he runs up to a small protrusion in the ground and tears away at the moss and dirt, revealing ancient runic letters etched upon stone. You walk up to it, tracing the words with your hand, reading them aloud:\n\n'This stone was raised in honour of Leif Eiriksson, discoverer and first king of Vinland.'\n\nYou step back in awe; this is the fabled Lost Runestone of Leif I."
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA50:0 "A legendary discovery!"
 flavor_vov.EVTNAME55:0 "Heart of Darkness"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC55:0 "It has come to our attention that prominent noblemen has been ordering attacks on skræling villages near his land for years, as to drive them off and expand his own holdings. His abuses are inexcusable, but his family's power makes him near-untouchable by anyone except the monarch. My liege, what should be done?"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTA55:0 "Pardon him"
 flavor_vov.EVTOPTB55:0 "Confiscate most of his land and sell it off"

 firstnations.1.d:0 "Thank you for trying out the Third Odyssey!\n\n You will now be playing as the once lost Mississippian nation known to us only as \"Cahokia\". Little is known of this civilization that left us with the ruins of their grandiose mound cities, that, in their prime, challenged the greatest of the European metropoles in size and population.\nIn this timeline however their cities still stand with streets filled with proud, strong folk that was able to overcome a series of terrible, near ruinous catastrophes. Now a shadow of their former gigantic selves, amidst wilderness, nomads and barbarian foreigners, they must rise to greatness yet again and bring the great city of Cahokia to new heights, as the hearth of the great Mississippi River!"
