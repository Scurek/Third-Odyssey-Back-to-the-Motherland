 nhs_countryevents.1.t:0 "Welcome to the Third Odyssey"
 nhs_countryevents.1.d:0 "The Emperor of Rome looks upon his realm - and despairs. To the east lie the lands of the hostile Turks, successors to the Arabs that battered Anatolia in times long past. To the west lie the Serbs and Hungarians, eager to carve up the pieces of a dying empire and expand their own dominion. The Varna Crusaders have been butchered. The legions of Rome once conquered the known world - but that was long ago. A lesser man might quail at these truths, but Ioannes and his brother Konstantinos are not lesser men. While delving into the depths of the Imperial Library for anything that might deliver them from destruction, the brothers located a hidden cache of information left behind by the exalted former emperor: Alexios Komnenos. The cache contained detailed schematics of dromons retrofitted with the deep-sea capabilities of the Ancient Roman vessels that plied the treacherous seas between the coasts of Hispania and the lands of the Celts in ages past, and was intended for a trading expedition to Varangian Vinland that never materialized. With them, the two brothers were able to scheme up a plan to hastily retrofit the remnants of the Imperial Navy to the designs, reinforced with modern construction techniques, and flee west in a new Odyssey, just as Aeneas fled Troy three thousand years ago."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME1:0 "The other three brothers will have to stay behind."
 nhs_countryevents.2.t:0 "Control over the Bay"
 nhs_countryevents.2.d:0 "We now have control over the entire Elysian Bay and all shipping passing through to our illustrious capital. We are once again in a position to demand toll from trade ships and control the flow of trade. The first bit of income has already come in!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME2:0 "Excellent. Money makes me merry!"
 nhs_countryevents.3.t:0 "The Gilded Keep of Elysia"
 nhs_countryevents.3.d:0 "We have access to good amounts of gold again now, and many of our advisors seem to think we should display our wealth and glory. They suggest we strengthen and beautify the central keep of New Constantinople and gild the main gate and tower peaks. Such a display of wealth would be costly, but our city would become the uncontested jewel of this entire continent!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME3A:0 "We must build it!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME3B:0 "Later perhaps..."
 nhs_countryevents.4.t:0 "Gift from a Local Chieftain"
 nhs_countryevents.4.d:0 "Emissaries from a local chieftain, awed by our great empire, arrived in New Constantinople today. He wishes to ally with the great Emperor, but fears he has no gift worthy of our stature. He offers you the greatest gift his clan can offer you: the hand of his youngest daughter, a most beautiful creature even to our standards. She looks away shyly but you caught a glimpse of the sparkling in her eyes. Officially you are already married, but nothing is to say the Gods don't abide polygamy. After all, Zeus himself would be quite the fan of such notion..."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME4A:0 "You accept the gift graciously and promise her well-being."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME4B:0 "You kindly reject the offer and express your thanks."
 nhs_countryevents.5.t:0 "Change of Strategies"
 nhs_countryevents.5.d:0 "With the increasing effectiveness of gunpowder based weapons like cannons, the usage of a weapon like Greek Fire declines. Whilst it is still more devastating, it is simply out-ranged by most contemporary cannons. However, as effectiveness and usage declines in the navy despite being increasingly easy to manufacture, this increase has led army commanders to adopt the chemical mixture as an essential component of clay grenades. They intend to use it more frequently to set fire to buildings or the ground to keep enemies at a distance, or just outright to put them on fire."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME5:0 "This was to be expected."
 nhs_countryevents.6.t:0 "Nobles employed as Cataphracts"
 nhs_countryevents.6.d:0 "Horses are still a rare commodity brought with us from the East. Ever since then we have tried to protect them from harm as much as possible. Our nobles protect their finest and strongest horses with heavy chain mail, like the Kataphraktoi of old, and this has allowed them to command troops safely from the front and join in on cavalry charges without much risk of lethal injuries. Should we encourage this development and adopt commanders and officers from the wealthy nobles only?"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME6A:0 "Yes, commanders are most useful on the front and alive."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME6B:0 "No, our command structure must be based on skill and experience."
 nhs_countryevents.7.t:0 "A True Nation"
 nhs_countryevents.7.d:0 "The Elysian nation is now well enough developed to be considered a true nation. We are no longer mere settlers in a foreign land, we have made this land ours and populated it far and wide. The natives still see us as newcomers, but have grown accustomed enough to deal with us like equals. May Elysia long prosper!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME7:0 "O glorious day!"
 nhs_countryevents.8.t:0 "Generals debate Military Doctrine"
 nhs_countryevents.8.d:0 "They have been in there for days now, leaving the war room only when furious and in need of a drink or when pissing isn't meant to illustrate insult. The generals are debating how to best organise the army, and they're clearly not going to get it figured out on their own. We've got to intervene before we lose some good commanders to an outright brawl!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME8A:0 "Well drilled specialists can withstand anything."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME8B:0 "A large army overwhelms anything."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME8C:0 "Stop squabbling, things are good as they are for now!"
 nhs_countryevents.9.t:0 "Gold discovered on Borders"
 nhs_countryevents.9.d:0 "The natives, in their unending attempts to rival us, have been in search of metals, iron in particular. It would happen then that by pure luck one of their mines has struck gold. However, this mine is just as close to one of our farms as it is to one of their villages. Since clear agreements on borders are lacking to say the least, we have just as much claim to this gold as they do. We must take control of this mine and the surrounding lands, for the glory of Elysia!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME9:0 "They can't use it anyway!"
 nhs_countryevents.11.t:0 "The Elysian Coasts"
 nhs_countryevents.11.d:0 "The settlers from Konstantinoupolis have really established themselves and secured a strong core region around the Elysian Bay. This has strengthened the wealth of our nation considerably, and our home city has flourished."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME11:0 "Elysia rises strong!"
 nhs_countryevents.12.t:0 "The Guardian Statues of Seagate"
 nhs_countryevents.12.d:0 "With solid control over the sea passage to our capital there are many who believe we should cement this dominance and make a lasting testament of our glory that can be seen by every ship that passes through Seagate. Several plans have already been made up for giant stone statues of guardians, doubling as lighthouses, to be built at the sides of the bay. The glorious nation of Elysia deserves a glorious entryway!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME12A:0 "Build these statues for the glory of Elysia!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME12B:0 "We can't afford that right now."
 nhs_countryevents.13.t:0 "Culture gradually changed to Elysian"
 nhs_countryevents.13.d:0 "It happened slowly but surely, years of isolation and life among the natives have influenced the culture and language of our people such that they can no longer be considered 'Hellenic'. Instead we have decided to style ourselves as Elysians, speaking in the Elysian tongue, fashioning Elysian clothing. One wonders what future will bring..."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME13:0 "What will be, will be."
 nhs_countryevents.14.t:0 "Cultural fragmentation becomes noticeable"
 nhs_countryevents.14.d:0 "Just like our culture changed away from our ancestral Hellenic, our people have spread far and wide and slight differences in behaviour and language have become noticeable. Our capital and surroundings have stayed as true as possible to the old ways, mostly because of the formal usage at court and among the many nobles in the area, and thus the local tongue is known as High Elysian. Closest to this are the coastal provinces, in heavy contact with the capital through constant trade and transport. They are referred to as Elyshians, with a 'shi', because of the rough pronunciation of the 's' that probably became popular among sailors to be better understood at sea where the waves and wind make conversation on deck difficult. The inland has been become known as home of the Elyric, those closest to the natives and with the highest adoption of their language. The natives that have been integrated in our country itself have also undergone change under our leadership, creating a new caste of Barbaroi."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME14:0 "We have become a fair lot!"
 nhs_set_seat_in_paliament_province_tt:0 "§Y[This.GetName]§! gains a seat in the Senate."
 nhs_countryevents.15.t:0 "Natives of [nhs_countryevents15_target.GetName] adapt our Language"
 nhs_countryevents.15.d:0 "Being exposed to our language, culture and through a more personal way of government, the natives in the province of [nhs_countryevents15_target.GetName] have adapted. They can now be considered Elysians... in the broad sense of the word."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME15:0 "Now if only they'd wash more regularly."
 nhs_countryevents.16.t:0 "Province's cultural ties become clear"
 nhs_countryevents.16.d:0 "One of our provinces has shown to not be as culturally refined as we first thought. This is probably because of the distance between them and our capital. They see themselves as Elysians though, just like we see them. Elysians with a little speech impediment that is, but nothing that our sophisticated minds can't overcome."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME16:0 "Hmpfff, well. We can't all be civilised I guess."
 nhs_countryevents.17.t:0 "Renewed production of Silk"
 nhs_countryevents.17.d:0 "With our citizens' wealth steadily increasing once again it has become once more profitable to produce silk. A closed of section of the capital has been given the sole rights to produce silk, and is highly supervised by royal administrators to ensure all parts of production remain separated and as secret as possible. The wealth of our ancestral capital has increased due to this monopoly on the finest of clothing."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME17:0 "Get on with it, my wife is nagging already!"
 elysian_silk:0 "Elysian Silk"
 elysian_silkDESC:0 "The finest silk in the entire known world. Feels like a cloud and looks like it's made of gold thread, it makes for a beautiful gleam that outshines the old Byzantine silk and even out does that of the Chinese."
 nhs_countryevents.18.t:0 "The Finest of Silk"
 nhs_countryevents.18.d:0 "Westerners had long imported silk through the Silk Routes. But now new silk is known to them, the Elysian silk, based on the secrets passed on through experts of Byzantine Constantinople. The secrets of production are only known in the Elysian capital, and closely guarded. The higher classes of the European nations are eagerly importing this finest of silk."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME18:0 "It feels nice, you've got to admit."
 ELYSIAN_SILK_BETTER:0 "Superiority of Elysian Silk"
 nhs_countryevents.21.t:0 "Riots at the Hippodrome"
 nhs_countryevents.21.d:0 "The latest races at the Hippodrome have led to outrage amongst the supporters, many of whom have resorted to violence to resolve the dispute. Rampaging supporters have already killed some city guards trying to keep the peace! We could try to isolate the hooligans in one part of the city and let them take out each other before mopping up with the city guard, but that would result in a lot of casualties, innocents included, and a good deal of damage to the suburbs. On the other hand, intervening would mean we have to deal with both groups of supporters..."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME21A:0 "Let them kill each other, good riddance."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME21B:0 "Send in the army to deal with it."
 nhs_countryevents.22.t:0 "Grand Race at the Hippodrome"
 nhs_countryevents.22.d:0 "The coming days there will be a grand race held at the Hippodrome. Red versus Blue, the top players these last few years will be divided into two groups and competing for four days in various disciplines. Bets can be placed on individual races and players, but what everyone is wondering is which team line up will ultimately prove to be most victorious. Both teams have asked for the Emperor's blessing and support for the coming games. Couple this to a bet and the treasury could get quite the boost if we prove to be lucky. With the divine blessings our Emperor receives though, there should be no doubt about that."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME22A:0 "Put a bet and send my blessings to the Blue team!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME22B:0 "Put a bet and send my blessings to the Red team!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME22C:0 "It would be unfair to side with either team!"
 nhs_countryevents.23.t:0 "Your Team was Victorious!"
 nhs_countryevents.23.d:0 "You have made a wise choice and supported the team that eventually proved victorious! Our investment is returning with some good gains!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME23:0 "Obviously. That was no surprise."
 nhs_countryevents.24.t:0 "Your Team was Defeated!"
 nhs_countryevents.24.d:0 "Regrettable your choice in what team to support has turned out to be wrong. We have lost our investment. I even think I saw that funny looking guy in the tribune mocking you when the victors were named!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME24:0 "We should have the bastard imprisoned..."
 nhs_countryevents.25.t:0 "Civilised Natives of [nhs_countryevents25_target.GetName] now even more Civilised"
 nhs_countryevents.25.d:0 "Being exposed to our language, culture and through a more personal way of government, the natives in [nhs_countryevents25_target.GetName] have adapted even further. They can now be considered true Elysians... in the same way commoners from the countryside are considered true Elysians of course."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME25:0 "They're almost there!"
 nhs_countryevents.26.t:0 "Expansion becomes Organised"
 nhs_countryevents.26.d:0 "Our nation's progress on the field of colonisation have rendered the spontaneous efforts of our people to cultivate more land obsolete. Colonisation is now directed and regulated by our government. This reduces friction with the natives considerably, since we try to respect their territory as much as possible."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME26:0 "Shame, I liked getting free land."
 nhs_countryevents.51.t:0 "The Shipwrecked Survivors"
 nhs_countryevents.51.d:0 "One of our ship captains came in contact with a familiar looking people on an island in the Atlantic. From the stories he gathered from these people it would seem they used to be part of a great expedition, and were stranded after a strong storm. Needless to say everyone in Elysia knows the stories of our past and news spread quickly that the lost were found, a glorious day for our people!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME51:0 "Prepare a ship, I wish to meet them!"
 nhs_countryevents.52.t:0 "The Glory of Elysia"
 nhs_countryevents.52.d:0 "As soon as your ships land on the island, the people of Lanthanopolis -'The Stranded City','The Lost City'- gather around and greet you with great joy. Most seem somewhat malnourished, but none of them are in too bad a shape. They seem to have done well for themselves and have established a small sustainable economy based on fishing, arboriculture and some goat herding. The leader of the people comes forward and invites you to join in the meagre feast they prepared. The people rejoice seeing as you brought along gifts of food of your own. Everyone is terribly impressed at how well Elysia has fared and the people shout your name. They want to join our realm, and are clearly enthusiastic about it!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME52A:0 "Welcome them with open arms!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME52B:0 "They'll manage fine on their own."
 nhs_countryevents.53.t:0 "The Glory of Elysia"
 nhs_countryevents.53.d:0 "As soon as your ships land on the island, the people of Lanthanopolis -'The Stranded City','The Lost City'- gather around and greet you with great joy. Most seem somewhat malnourished, but none of them are in too bad a shape. They seem to have done well for themselves and have established a small sustainable economy based on fishing, arboriculture and some goat herding. When they notice the strange signs and behaviour of our priests it becomes apparent that they are Christians, and very surprised by our strange new religion. Distrust spreads between our party and the locals, and you wonder what you should do. We could return later in full glory and convince them of our legitimacy, making them renounce their false God, or it might be better to just leave them alone in their heathen ways and deny they are truly our people."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME53A:0 "Convince them of the power and glory of Elysia and our Gods!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME53B:0 "Leave them to their own doing."
 nhs_countryevents.54.t:0 "The Atlantic Island"
 nhs_countryevents.54.d:0 "With our new policies to encourage exploration of the world, some of our explorers reported spotting a small island in the Atlantic in their seemingly futile quest eastwards. This has certainly encouraged our explorers to continue exploring even further East, to no avail at this time, so they suggest investigating the possibility of a forward outpost there to increase the range of our vessels."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME54:0 "Seems like a lonely place."
 nhs_countryevents.101.t:0 "Local Noble Rises to Power"
 nhs_countryevents.101.d:0 "Our connection to the inland population has always been much smaller than with those along the coasts and near our capital. The system of governance was adapted for this problem by instituting traditional nobles in a feudal order responsible for their part of the realm. By employing the traditional noble class like this we also inherited the problems we faced in medieval times, since we continued to give our nobles their privileges. One of the higher inland nobles has now taken control of a good deal of land, through power disputes, marriage and allying lesser lords now loyal to him. He realizes very well what position he is in, and has already redistributed wealth and power to himself from the cities he protects. The city senators are too loyal or, more likely, too afraid to express any opinions in the senate other than those of their protector. If we do not deal with this threat in some way the country may fracture entirely as other protector lords claim more power of their own!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME101A:0 "Give more power in exchange for his loyalty."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME101B:0 "Let's take care of him now while we can."
 nhs_countryevents.102.t:0 "Merchant Guild Rises to Power"
 nhs_countryevents.102.d:0 "Since our reinstatement of the merchant class we made sure trade was well organised and supervised. Once the system was up and running there was no real need for the state to spend money regulating trade, instead we gave this power to a merchant's guild. They registered merchants and taxed trade in our name, sharing half the income with the state. A win-win for both: trade got regulated by professionals that weren't on our payroll, and the Merchant Guild could finance further investment and expansion with the money they made. Although trade has been booming, the shares we have been receiving from the guild didn't keep pace and this has gradually resulted in a mismatch between the shares the Guild has been taking and those flowing to the state. The Guild has grown rather bold and denies any accusations of corruption, though they clearly have greater funds than they should be able to under the agreement. We must come to some sort of agreement soon lest we risk being overtaken by a wealthy merchant class!"
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME102A:0 "Give them more autonomy to keep them busy."
 NHSCOUNTRYEVENTSNAME102B:0 "Return them to our direct control, by force if needed."
