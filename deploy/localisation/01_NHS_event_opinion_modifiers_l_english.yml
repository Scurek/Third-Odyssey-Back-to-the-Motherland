 nhs_handicap_settlers:0 "Manpower Shortage"
 desc_nhs_handicap_settlers:0 "Because we have only recently founded our settlement and have only the people we brought with us, however many they may be, we have a serious lack of manpower. We simply can't spare any extra settlers to occupy themselves with protecting the settlement. This is even truer for our cavalry, we have a great lack of horses and will need substantial breeding to get the amount required for army use."
 nhs_constrained_resources:0 "Constrained Resources"
 desc_nhs_constrained_resources:0 "We are unable to move too far from our territory to expand because of the lack of roads, supply ships, and adequate organisation of our long range expansionary efforts. This translates to a practical inability to supply island colonies or territories not immediately connected to our own. If we can somehow find the strength and economical power to restore this capability, we would have so much more potential!"
 nhs_organised_expansion:0 "Organised Expansion"
 desc_nhs_organised_expansion:0 "We have created a national institution to regulate and organise our expansionary efforts. Our colonies can be supplied at great distances and people are more attracted by the prospect of new land coupled with strong support from the homeland."

 desc_nhs_expanded_pantheon:0 "We have embraced a good number of Gods from other beliefs or have connected them to our own to expand our Pantheon and corresponding Mythos. There are many Gods in this world, and it would be wrong to simply discard the ones we don't already know. Our High Priests watch over the correct adoption and worship of significant unknown Gods, and a greater number of worshipper are now included in our religious society."
 nhs_consolidated_pantheon:0 "Consolidated Pantheon"
 desc_nhs_consolidated_pantheon:0 "We have consolidated our existing Pantheon of Gods to cement the authority and importance of the faith in people's daily lives.

 nhs_extended_city_senate:0 "Extended Senate of Cities"

 nhs_silk_quarter:0 "The Silk Quarter"
 desc_nhs_silk_quarter:0 "This quarter houses both the workshops and the homes of those working in the silk production. Every part of the manufacturing process is carefully separated from the rest, so very few people actually know and understand the full process.

 desc_nhs_elysian_fort_2:0 "In their slow, shameful defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Hellenes learned the importance of strong fortifications for the survival and prosperity of the nation.

 nhs_elysian_fort_3:0 "Expanded Fortifications (III)"
 desc_nhs_elysian_fort_3:0 "In their slow, shameful defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Hellenes learned the importance of strong fortifications for the survival and prosperity of the nation. This knowledge translated into tradition, and that tradition led to impressive defences all over Elysia. The fortifications of this stronghold have reached a level of perfection.
