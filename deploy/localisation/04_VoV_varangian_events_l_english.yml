 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.1.d:0 "Led by an Elysian akolouthos, the Varangian Order have established a small stronghold on the northern cape.\nThe members of the Guard are made up of non-Elysian foreigners, both Native and Norse, due to their detachment from the politics of the Empire. All members of this order are put through a brutal training program, and only the greatest warriors make it through. They have pledged to protect the Emperor and the wider Empire from foreign threats and aid us in upcoming wars, as long as we provide them with enough gold..." 
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.1.a:0 "May they be our shield in the North"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.2.d:0 "The Greek Emperor has established the Varangian Order on a cape to our south. They consist mostly of fellow Vinlanders and Skraelings that have been lured by the promise of gold and glory. They claim that it is their intent to protect the Empire from foreign threats as well provide safe passage for merchants and travellers between our borders. With no ill-intent towards our nation, they welcome all that wish to join them, provided they have the skill."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.3.d:0 "The Emperor of the Elysians has founded the Varangian Order on the southern cape to the north of their capital. A powerful military faction, it is mostly formed of Natives and Norsemen that pledged their loyalty to the Emperor and their lives to defend the Empire from outside threats."

 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.5.t:0 "Varangians transfer newly conquered province"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.5.d:0 "The Varangians have recently expanded their domain outside of their specified borders. They have agreed to transfer control of their newly acquired province to us, as was our agreement when they were given land."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.5.a:0 "Ok"

 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.6.d:0 "While Varangians have grown quite influential in the realm, we are still able still decide on which land they will govern over."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.6.f:0 "...they would prefer however, if we just left the decision to them."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.6.g:0 "I've changed my mind, they shall remain in the capital for now."
 
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.8.t:0 "Northern Warriors Offer Services"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.8.d:0 "A band of seasoned, if impulsive, Viking warriors have offered their services as mercenaries to the emperor of the Romans. In return for regular pay and lodgings in New Constantinople, they have agreed to convert to [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and fight alongside our warriors. With some training (and a lot of gold) they should become fine warriors in Imperial service."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.8.a:0 "We need all the soldiers we can get in this strange new world."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.8.b:0 "We have no need of these barbarian Northmen."
 
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.9.t:0 "Growing Varangian Influence"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.9.d:0 "The Viking warriors under our employ have earned a fearsome reputation for themselves over the past few years. Their courage and ferocity on the battlefield has helped us win many a battle against the far more numerous Barbaroi, often snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. In the capital, they have gained considerable influence with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],  who has recently made them part of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bodyguard, much like the Varangians of old. This has caused a stir among the Dynatoi of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], who are wary of having these barbarian foreigners so close to the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Whether the concerns of the nobility will be validated or not is yet to be seen, but there is little doubt that the power of these so called 'Varangians' will continue to grow if left unchecked."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.9.a:0 "They grow in prestige every day."
 
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.10.t:0 "Varangians demand their own land"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.10.d:0 "Members of the Varangian Guard have become increasingly restless in recent months. They argue that their role as bodyguard to the Emperor entitles them to their own grants of land, similar to what we give our own troops once they finish their military service. While we certainly do not lack for space, to give in to the demands of these barbarian foreigners will no doubt lower the Emperor's standing among [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people. On the other hand, to refuse them may put the lives of the imperial family at risk."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.10.a:0 "Very well, they do have a point."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.10.b:0 "No. They go too far."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.10.c:0 "Offer them gold, that will help ensure their loyalty for now."
 
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.11.t:0 "Varangians return with their demands"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.11.d:0 "Varangian officials have once again returned to demand what they perceive to be rightfully theirs. We could either respond to their demands or offer them compensation from our treasury."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.11.a:0 "Very well, give them their land."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.11.b:0 "No. They go too far."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.11.c:0 "Open the coffers again."
 
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.12.t:0 "Island of Malta"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.12.d:0 "Our invasion of the old world continues apace, with the Emperor and his war council receiving daily reports on the progress of the campaign and enemy troop movements from the safety of the capital. A Varangian on the council suggested that if we were to take control of the island of Malta, it would provide them with a fortress in the central Mediterranean Sea from which to launch an assault on Hellas proper. Relocation to such a far-flung colony would also hopefully shift their focus away from domestic affairs."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.12.a:0 "It's worth considering..."

 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.13.d:0 "Our invasion of the old world continues apace, with the Emperor and his war council receiving daily reports on the progress of the campaign and enemy troop movements from the safety of the capital. A former member of the Varangian Guard suggested that if we were to take control of the island of Malta, it would provide them with a fortress in the central Mediterranean Sea from which to launch an assault on Hellas proper. Re-establishing the Varangians and providing them with new land far from the capital should help ensure their loyalty once again."

Luckily, some of their most elite warriors managed to mount a sortie and are making their way back to the capital. We can now begin to rebuild their numbers in a more defensible location, though we could take advantage of their weakness and disband them..."

 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.15.da:0 "Much to the delight of the Varangian guard, we have finally managed to secure a province that would serve them well as their new headquarters. It will take some time, but they will soon be ready to defend our homeland once again."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.15.db:0 "Our troops accompanied by ever vigilant Varangian warriors have recaptured Malta and are already reestablishing their control over the island. It will take some time, but they will soon be ready to support our invasion of the motherland."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.15.g:0 "All going as planned..."

 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.16.d:0 "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is abuzz with commotion as news spreads throughout the city that a knife wielding assassin attacked the Emperor and his entourage this morning. Though a high ranking noble was killed in the struggle, the captain of the Varangian guard felled the assailant before he could escape. Unfortunately, the identity of the would be assassin and their employer are a mystery, though we have our suspicions..."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.16.a:0 "Let's just congratulate the Varangians on a job well done."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.16.b:0 "It was a disgruntled noble!"

 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.17.t:0 "Varangians rampaging through the capital"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.17.d:0 "It seems that members of the Varangian Guard have had too much of a good time, and are currently roaming the streets of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], setting fire to buildings and harassing the locals. If they are not contained quickly, they may cause extensive damage to a number of important guild production buildings located in the area. However, their usefulness in battle may be worth overlooking their antics just this once?"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.17.a:0 "Let them tire themselves out."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.17.b:0 "Send in the City Guard."
 
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.18.t:0 "Varangians want to return home"
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.18.da:0 "A band of some of our most loyal and experienced Varangian warriors have requested permission to return to their homeland. Tired of constant battle, they feel that they have earned their keep and fulfilled their pledge to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We could try and sweeten the deal by providing them with prestigious military positions, though it may be difficult. Alternatively the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could use their authority and compel them to stay, though this will not endear us to them."

 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.19.d:0 "An argument has recently broken out between the Elysian-led Epilektoi and the Varangian guard over who should guard the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] during [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] daily religious processions. The Epilektoi are calling the religious commitment of the Varangians into question, calling them nothing more than barbarians and heathens. The Varangians in return see the Epilektoi as decadent sons of petty nobles who have never seen true battle, and are unworthy protectors of the Emperor. It will be difficult, if not impossible to get them to work together, and as such we may have no choice but to pick a side."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.19.a:0 "We will side with our Elysian brothers!."
 nhs_vov_varangian_order_events.19.b:0 "I'm afraid the Varangians have a point."
