 nhs2_powhatan_deal_desc:0 "It's a rare opportunity to do diplomacy with the native peoples, but now we have a chance to avoid war. If we could provide the Powhatan with a generous gift of gold and weapons we can convince them to leave their current land and move further south, away from our claimed territory."
 nhs_powhatan_deal.2.t:0 "Elysians Offer Deal"
 nhs_powhatan_deal.2.d:0 "A diplomat from the rapidly expanding Elysian nation has offered us a deal. He has a large amount of gold and weapons for us, and in exchange for that he asks us to leave \"rightful Elysian territory\". Not only will this give us an advantage against the tribes, but we can prevent (or at least delay) war with the foreigners."

 nhs_powhatan_deal.4.t:0 "Deal Refused"
 nhs_powhatan_deal.4.d:0 "The Powhatan have refused our deal. At least they had the decency to send back the gift, but clearly war is inevitable."

 nhs_powhatan_deal.5.t:0 "The Powhatan"
 nhs_powhatan_deal.5.d:0 "We have fought several skirmishes with the local native populace, but we now have the opportunity to conduct diplomacy with them. One of the tribes, named Powhatan, has expressed a lust for our silver and our spears. We also have a need to expand our territory beyond our little harbor. Perhaps we could come to an accord with them in the future, where they migrate south in exchange for some of our wealth and weapons of war. It would be an effective way to conserve our critically-low manpower..."
 nhs_powhatan_deal.5.a:0 "Peace in our time?"
 nhs_unlock_powhatan_deal_dec_tt:0 "Enables decision: §Y'Deal with the Powhatan'§!"
