 nhs_hellenicconversion1.d:0 "Gemistus Pletho was one of the few brilliant minds we could not afford to leave behind as we turned our back on our homeland. A gifted philosopher and scholar, his contributions had not gone unnoticed by our late Basileus, something which allowed him the opportunity of safe passage to these new strange lands we have come to call home. In his waning years however it has come clear that Pletho holds some controversial if not outright heretical beliefs. Alarmingly he appears to recognise this and has publicly challenged members of our clergy as well as members of the royal family to debate him. While we cannot at the moment afford to expand the energy to rid ourselves of this man nor could we risk losing such a reliable advisor the following years will surely tell us if we were right in letting this heathen board our ships."
