 nhs_hellenicconversion1.t:0 "A Troublesome Heretic"
 nhs_hellenicconversion1.d:0 "Georgios Gemistos Plethon was one of the few brilliant minds we could not afford to leave behind as we turned our back on our homeland. A gifted philosopher and scholar, his contributions had not gone unnoticed by our late Basileus, something which allowed him the opportunity of safe passage to these new strange lands we have come to call home. In his waning years however it has come clear that Pletho holds some controversial if not outright heretical beliefs. Alarmingly he appears to recognise this and has publicly challenged members of our clergy as well as members of the royal family to debate him. While we cannot at the moment afford to expand the energy to rid ourselves of this man nor could we risk losing such a reliable advisor the following years will surely tell us if we were right in letting this heathen board our ships."

 hellenicconversion_preacher.tt:0 "§MOur decisions and actions regarding the growing neo-pagan community may lead to unrest, and if we do not maintain neutrality we will be courting disaster.§!"

 nhs_hellenicconversion101.t:0 "Pagans Refuse to Pay Taxes."
 nhs_hellenicconversion101.d:0 "Some of our citizens - in particular farmers - have been courted by heathens. As such they have come to believe that, being an un-represented minority within our country, they are not beholden to paying their taxes unlike our other more faithful subjects. The church has made it clear that this is an outrage and if we do not act now it will only embolden the pagan riff raff. Some have gone as far as to suggest that we should put this down by the sword if need be. Others - in particular voices within our own court - have suggested that we should exercise caution and favour a more pragmatic solution entirely."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.101.a:0 "Seize the pagans' fortune."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.101.b:0 "Intensify taxation efforts."

 nhs_hellenicconversion.101.d:0 "We can skip on taxes, this time."

 nhs_hellenicconversion102.t:0 "Orthodox Zealots Take to the Streets."
 nhs_hellenicconversion102.d:0 "Following a heated exchange between a pagan preacher and a priest, a mob of fanatical faithful have been roused by members of our clergy. The mob descended on the homes of accused heretics. Some have already been killed, but many are still awaiting trial as they are detained by the zealots. This puts us in a precarious position as intervening in any way may signal that we have taken a side. Even intervening just for the sake of sparing those who may be innocent may be seen as an attempt to protect heretics from God's rightful justice."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.102.a:0 "Burning heretics? Sounds like a great idea!"
 nhs_hellenicconversion.102.b:0 "Let them be judged by God."

 nhs_hellenicconversion.102.d:0 "Restore order in the province."

 nhs_hellenicconversion103.t:0 "Priest Murdered by Crowd"
 nhs_hellenicconversion103.d:0 "A clergyman was found to be murdered on the edges of our territory. While the locals were quick to deflect blame to the natives, the Patriarch suggested otherwise. Instead, he has accused the locals themselves of conspiring against the devout and having murdered the priest themselves, using the natives as a scapegoat for their actions."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.103.a:0 "Blame the locals and have them tried for being heretics."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.103.b:0 "Blame the natives for the murder."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.103.c:0 "Refuse to have the crown involved in the matter."

 nhs_hellenicconversion104.t:0 "Orthodox Faithful Angered by Inaction"
 nhs_hellenicconversion104.d:0 "The presence and seeming toleration of heathens within our country has caused various clergy members as well as devout courtiers to express their frustration, going as far as to demand that the crown make a public statement on the matter, catching our Basileus off-guard during a meeting with our advisors. How should we react?"
 nhs_hellenicconversion.104.a:0 "Publicly condemn the neo-pagan movement."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.104.b:0 "Refuse to hear out the priest."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.104.c:0 "Make vague statements of support."

 nhs_hellenicconversion105.t:0 "Neo-Pagan Settlers"
 nhs_hellenicconversion105.d:0 "As we push further outwards into this new land we have come to call home, our people have begun to settle the wild edeges of our nascent empire. While this is seen as an opportunity by many it is also, for some, a way to live in peace. Our country is experiencing rapbidly increasing tensions between members of our clergy and other devout orthodox people on one side, and pagan disciples on the other. Among the latter, some have taken to the colonies as a means of worshipping in peace. This has stirred fears of heathen enclaves being established in the countryside, an area of lawlessness. Among out court, people have begun contemplating outright expusling these heathens - even if that would be at the expense of slowing our expansion down."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.105.a:0 "Conversion or expulsion it is."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.105.b:0 "Let them be."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.105.c:0 "Let them be and make sure they are protected."

 nhs_hellenicconversion106.t:0 "Neo-Pagan Flee Religious Violence"
 nhs_hellenicconversion106.d:0 "Owing to a combination of inaction on our part, church persecution and rising public violence a some members of the pagan community have set out to flee. Once settlers in the fringes of our realm, they have declared their intention to abandon the safety of Elysia for the untamed lands which surround us. While we should rejoice that these wretched heathens have taken upon themselves to purge our country of their presence, we should also be careful as to not de-populate our colonies and thus reverse our hard-earned progress. How may we best approach this matter, and how should the crown conduct itself?"
 nhs_hellenicconversion.106.a:0 "Stop them!"
 nhs_hellenicconversion.106.b:0 "Let them go but seize their wealth."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.106.c:0 "Let them go."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.106.d:0 "Send in some Orthodox settlers to replace them."

 nhs_hellenicconversion107.t:0 "Advisor Accused of Pagan Sympathies"
 nhs_hellenicconversion107.d:0 "The conflict between the heathens and our clergy may appear distant to our Basileus but just like Georgios Gemistos Plethon himself found his way onto one of our ships, so has another heretic found its way into our court. The evidence presented by the Patriarch is staggering and leaves little room for doubt. While an immediate arrest would certainly earn us the favour of our clergy, a fair trial may be more appropriate. When confronted, the advisor flatly denied the evidence while also defending their right to their own belief, accusing our Patriarch of excessive zeal. The matter is, however, entirely in our Basileus' hands."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.107.a:0 "Arrest them."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.107.b:0 "Fire them."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.107.c:0 "Stand by them."
 nhs_hellenicconversion.107.d:0 "Arrange for a quiet retirement."
