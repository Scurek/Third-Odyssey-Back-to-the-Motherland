 greek_armoured_billsDESCR:0 "The Pronoia gradually moved to unify their equipment as Elysia moved inland, using quick-loading crossbows and wearing heavy armour to shrug off the arrows and bone spears of enemy natives. Their Astyphylakes cousins, meanwhile, abandoned the arbalest as impractical in city fighting, moving to halberds and heavy plate armour."
 greek_armoured_dragoons_modernDESCR:0 "These riders return to their roots, being heavily-armored horsemen in a world increasingly dominated by light cavalry and musketeers. Their weaponry, however, is decidedly modern: these riders shoot carbines from horseback, and can dismount and fight on foot if the situation calls for it."
 greek_cataphractDESCR:0 "The Romans took with them into exile numerous horses, mainly warhorses fit for battle. These cavalrymen fought in the traditional Eastern Roman manner - with bow and sword, riding moderately armored horses. The Roman cavalry was not numerous, however, and their armies could consist of a maximum of twenty percent cavalry."
 greek_charge_cataphractDESCR:0 "The Elysian army eventually moved from their traditional Themata cavalry to the true Cataphracts of ages past. Carrying lance, mace, and bow; and with both horse and rider clad in heavy mail, these soldiers proves to be nearly-unstoppable to the natives."
 greek_combined_formationDESCR:0 "While the Astyphylakes continued to guard Elysian cities, the Pronoia of the Dynatoi were gradually replaced by Imperial Akritai, who fought in much the same manner as the Pronoia before them - with heavy armour, crossbow, and polearm - but who now served directly under Imperial jurisdiction instead of feudal nobles."
 greek_combined_rifles_modernDESCR:0 "The Elysian Empire eventually formed Imperial Guard regiments - heavy infantry armoured with cuirass and helmet; and armed with rifle, bayonet, and sword. These were drawn from the best of the Tagmata and they accompanied the emperor on campaign."
 greek_crossbowDESCR:0 "The Roman exiles were eventually able to form their armies in Themata units instead of the smaller Tourma squadrons. They were a still the semi-feudal soldiers their ancestors were, armed primarily with spear, shield, and the easy-to-use crossbow."
 greek_medieval_infantryDESCR:0 "When the exiled Romans first arrived to the New World, they attempted to emulate the military organization of their predecessor empire; however, they lacked the manpower to form more than singular regiments, or Tourma, and so could not form into the expansive Themata armies or Tagmata regiments."
 greek_new_model_crossbowDESCR:0 "The common Elysian soldier, at this point, was a Pronoia infantryman, typically armed with a bow or crossbow and a polearm such as a glaive or billhook. These soldiers are levied under the Dynatoi nobles and guard the Elysian borders, as opposed to the Astyphylakes city garrisons, who carried arbalest, shield, and spear."
 greek_order_infantry_modernDESCR:0 "As knowledge of European tactics increased, so too did Elysian usage of them. Tagmata battalions armed with musket and bayonet and cuirass took the place of Akritai skirmishers and soldiers."
 greek_reformed_cataphractDESCR:0 "Elysians, in later stages, referred to all cavalry as "kataphraktoi", regardless of role. These particular light cavalry are armed with specially-designed light revolving crossbows and sabres for melee. Armoured only with a cuirass, these riders are nevertheless fine horsemen."
 greek_revolving_crossbowDESCR:0 "As Elysian military tactics continued to evolve, so to did the role of Elysian soldiers. Akritai were no longer border guards, but were now the main soldiers of the empire, given halberds and arbalests and armored in heaviest plate to ward off even the strongest native blows. This had the downside of tremendously slowing the soldier, but this was deemed of secondary concern to survivability."
 greek_rifle_skirmishers_modernDESCR:0 "When Elysia rediscovered the Europeans, they also rediscovered European gunpowder. This caused a shift among the entire military: no more were heavily-armored footsoldiers with polearms and arbalests supreme. Instead, the Elysian soldiers discarded most of their restricting armor and exchanged their crossbows for muskets, fighting mainly as skirmishers thanks for the relatively low manpower."
 greek_woods_cavalryDESCR:0 "Heavy Cataphracts are nigh-unstoppable in melee, but are poor at combating light troops, as heavy armor tires the horse quickly. These troops are clad in medium armor, and the horse is entirely unarmored, but the rider retains a his weapons, making these troops fearsome light cavalry."
 greek_woods_huntersDESCR:0 "A continuation of the Light Cataphract, these men use a sword and light crossbow. They use their mobility to cut off the enemy's line of retreat, and constantly harass their rear from a safe distance before riding down the shattered remnants."

 greek_astyfylakes_garrison:0 "Astyphylakes Garrison"
 greek_astyfylakes_garrisonDESCR:0 "As opposed to the feudal Pronoia infantry, the Astyphylakes, or City Guard, were levied directly by city magisters on the Emperor's authority. This meant that the Astyphylakes received their pay directly from the Imperial Treasury, ensuring their loyalty. This also meant that there was occasional conflict between the Emperor and the private levies of the Dynatoi noblemen."

No longer were they only city guards, but now they also patrolled the streets and guarded the Emperor's properties as a means of securing them from the Pronoia."

They could be called to war by the Emperor, who still controlled the Akritai directly. These troops were usually used in the same manner as their predecessors: as garrison units to guard cities and patrol roads."

 greek_pistokynigos_modernDESCR:0 "As the Elysians encountered Europeans, it soon became apparent that methods of combating them were to be given top priority. The result was the Pisto Kynigoi, the "Faithful Hunters". Swearing an oath of loyalty to the Emperor, these soldiers performed scout duties for the nascent Tagmata Corps, and, when forced into battle, deployed in a light skirmish line, ambushing and sniping with heavy rifles at range and attacking with halberds in melee combat."
 greek_pezikou_skirmishers_modern:0 "Pezikou Skirmishers"
 greek_pezikou_skirmishers_modernDESCR:0 "The Pistokynigoi soon evolved into the Pezikou Skirmish Corps, assisting the Imperial Tagmata in battle.

 greek_thorakipezikou_modern:0 "Thora Infantry"
 greek_thorakipezikou_modernDESCR:0 "As opposed to the Imperial Guard Riflemen, who defended the Emperor, these men attacked in his name, waving banners depicting the double-headed eagle. Armed with heavy muskets, polearm-bayonets, and light field artillery; and armored in heaviest mail even in the days of Line Infantry, these soldiers were relentlessly drilled on the attack. They acted as the vanguard in all campaigns the Elysians conducted against the Europeans."
