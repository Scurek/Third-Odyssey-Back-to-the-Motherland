 nhs_vin1_Viking_MarauderDESCR:0 "Raider warbands that fight for plunder, these warriors are lightly equipped and ill-disciplined, but fierce in battle. They make for excellent light infantry, and will often fight for the most prestigious leader."
 nhs_vin4a_Viking_HirdmenDESCR:0 "The Hirdmen are the personal companions and retinues of chiefs, petty kings, and other assorted Norse nobility. These warriors are well-armed with spear and swords, and armoured in mail."
 nhs_vin4b_Northern_SpearwallDESCR:0 "These levy spearmen are a cut above the usual raiders, possessing some discipline and knowledge of battlefield tactics. What they lack in individual skill, they make up for in numbers and the ability to support each other."
 nhs_vin9a_Vinlandic_HuskarlarDESCR:0 "More formalized than the Hirdmen, these warriors are still the retinue of Vinlandic nobility. Possessing high morale and quality equipment, the Huskarlar are, individually at least, the match of any southern soldier."
 nhs_vin9b_Nordic_LongspearmenDESCR:0 "Levy spearmen who decided that a six-foot-long spear wasn’t long enough, these warbands are almost impervious to frontal charges. Though still vulnerable at range, only the push of pike will dislodge them in melee."
 nhs_vin14a_Varangian_VeteransDESCR:0 "Viking warriors formerly under the employ of the Elysians, these veterans have extensive experience as elite shock troops. Often used by the Elysians to charge enemy weak points and defend threatened positions, they are the pinnacle of Viking battle prowess."
 nhs_vin14b_Crossbow_RaidersDESCR:0 "While the shortbow has acted as the primary ranged weapon of Viking skirmishers for centuries, the increased power and range afforded by Elysian-style crossbows has resulted in their widespread adoption by marauders and raiders."
 nhs_vin18a_Viking_PistoliersDESCR:0 "As firearms proliferate from Elysia, the Viking warbands of the cold north waste no time in adapting to the new reality of warfare. These light infantrymen carry pistols to fire at range in place of the throwing spears of ages past, and then close to range with axes and swords."
 nhs_vin18b_Vinlandic_PikewallDESCR:0 "These warriors disdain the firearms of the south, viewing them as decadent. They instead form up in blocks of pikemen, an evolution of the spearwalls of old. Disciplined and battle-hardened, these warriors are a useful addition to any force."
 nhs_vin23a_Palecoat_Heavy_InfantryDESCR:0 "Named for their distinctive almost-colourless greatcoats, these fierce musketeers are deadly on the charge and are equipped with axehead bayonets for use in melee."
 nhs_vin23b_Expatriate_Light_InfantryDESCR:0 "Formed from the ranks of Elysians, Spartans, and Europeans, these soldiers, exiled from their homes, lend their skilled gunnery and skirmish tactics to the cause of Vinland."
 nhs_vin27a_Palecoat_GrenadiersDESCR:0 "Specialized Palecoat units armed with large, heavy grenades. These burly infantrymen advance to close range and throw their grenades, using their superior resolve to fight through losses dealt by longer-ranged enemies."
 nhs_vin27b_Nordland_JaegersDESCR:0 "Hunters and woodsmen from the far north of Vinland, formed into light skirmish units. Armed with axes and blunderbusses, these northmen are skilled at the ambush and raid tactics of their ancestors."
 nhs_vin30a_Nordland_GuardDESCR:0 "Elite heavy infantry hearkening back to their raider ancestors of yore with scale armor, heavy muskets, and halberd bayonets. These hardy shock infantry are recruited from the far north of Vinland, at the top of the world."
 nhs_vin30b_Vinlandic_MarinesDESCR:0 "Descended from Viking raiders, these unarmoured infantry are more at home on a ship than on land. Most of these hardened soldiers eschew ranged weapons entirely, or carry only pistols, and instead bring large halberds, poleaxes, and swords into battle. Outdated in the modern age, but no less fearsome for that."

 jomsviking_squareDESCR:0 "When highly outnumbered or outflanked, the Jomsvkings' armies fall back on the proven square formation, holding a position with their legendary discipline."
 vinlandic_long-musketmenDESCR:0 "Hunting was deeply embedded in Vinlandic culture, and as a result Vinlandic gunsmiths often favour large, long and expensive muskets that are more accurate than traditional muskets of the time."
 jomsviking_black-coatsDESCR:0 "Having its origins in the Jomsviking Order, the Black-Coats are proficient in withstanding fire volleys and being conservative with their supplies. Relying in their zealous morale and unorthodox tactics, they are as efficient as they are deadly."
 vinlandic_heavy-riflemenDESCR:0 "By the early 19th century, Vinland's use of long rifles had evolved into the use of the Tungbysso, a particularly large and heavy rifle that was devastating when fired. While less useful on open plains, it is ideal for the thick forests and rocky lands of the North."
 jomsviking_skirmishersDESCR:0 "The simple threat of Jomsviking snipers can keep most enemy officers in their tents. The Jomsvikings rely in that fear when enacting their now infamous flanking tactics."
