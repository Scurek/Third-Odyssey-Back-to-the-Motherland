 cossack_estate_events.1.d:0 "The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] complain that an increasing number of serfs are deserting the safe homes provided to them to seek their fortune among the Cossacks of the Steppes. They feel we are to blame as we have allowed the Cossacks to grow too powerful which is inspiring the serfs to abandon their rightful masters.\nRepresentatives of the major families now demand that we limit the power of the Cossacks so that they can expand their latifundia in the regions bordering the steppe. This way, they argue, the wild fields can be tamed and the laws of the realm upheld."
 cossack_estate_events.2.d:0 "Moving quickly by boat or on horseback, the Cossacks of the steppes are very adept raiders. Several such raids have lately laid waste to our countryside and even major cities some way from our borders. Once the raids have been executed these plunderers retreat back behind the borders of [cossacks_here_target.GetName] as quickly as they came. Both the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] and our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have interests in the affected areas and both groups now demand that we do something."
 cossack_estate_events.6.d:0 "While few would dispute their influence on the Steppes the Cossacks have many things working against them when it comes to gaining influence in the halls of power. The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] despise them and would see them all brought to work as serfs on their latifundia and their manners have not brought them many friends in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nLately, however, things have been going their way. They have managed to defend their settlements and their services to the state as raiders are indisputable."
 cossack_estate_events.14.d:0 "The old dream of the Cossacks has always been to be accepted as the equals to the established estates such as the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] or $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Never has this dream been closer to realization than now. The Cossacks have achieved great influence in our state and in many ways we rely on their support.\nGiven the favorable circumstances many Cossacks are now voicing their old demands for official recognition and privileges."
 church_estate_events.8.d:0 "Many land donations are quite old and while they are always written down both landscape and names may well have changed since a donation was originally written. Recently the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have been accusing several members of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] of outright land theft in the form of encroaching on lands donated to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ long ago. The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] on the other hand argue that it is the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ who are trying to seize land areas they do not own.\nWhoever we decide to side with will become the majority land holder in the area."
 church_estate_events.8.b:0 "Side with the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]."
 nobles_estate_events.1.d:0 "Many of the families of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"
 nobles_estate_events.2.t:0 "Advancement of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]"
 nobles_estate_events.2.d:0 "The state is not the sole source of influence in our country. Over the last few decades a charismatic champion of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] has successfully managed to increase the power of the leading families of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] over most of the institutions of our country.\nContacts and privileges can be powerful things, especially combined with ambition."
 nobles_estate_events.3.t:1 "Encroachment of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] in [noble_encroachment.GetName]"
 nobles_estate_events.3.d:1 "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties in [noble_encroachment.GetName] considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."
 nobles_estate_events.4.d:0 "A representative of the people living in an area dominated by one of the most prominent families of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] has approached the throne today imploring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take action against what he claims are systematic abuses of power against the people there. As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."
 nobles_estate_events.5.t:0 "Declining Power of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]"
 nobles_estate_events.5.d:0 "As both influential land owners and the traditional warrior class in our state the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] have not fared well lately. Through a combination of excessive infighting and poorly coordinated power plays the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] have lost influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and many have retired to their properties in the countryside."
 nobles_estate_events.6.t:0 "[Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] demand Stricter Sumptuary Laws"
 nobles_estate_events.6.d:0 "Expensive clothes, great banquettes and impressive palaces are some of the most visible symbols of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] but the degree to which one family has money to spend on such things can vary greatly. In some cases the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They now suggest a number of heavy fines for anyone trying to rise visibly above their betters."

 nobles_estate_events.7.d:0 "In time many of the everyday occurrences in the life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors has become the subject of ceremony. Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] would likely resent it."
 nobles_estate_events.8.t:0 "Deteriorating Relations with the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]"
 nobles_estate_events.8.d:0 "Relations between the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could hardly be worse. The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."
 nobles_estate_events.9.t:0 "Insubordinate [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]"
 nobles_estate_events.9.d:0 "None of our subjects are more associated with war than the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]. Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."
 nobles_estate_events.10.d:1 "As the state and its bureaucracy grow there is an ever-growing need of people to oversee and administrate various lands and functions. The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] have traditionally been more associated with military services to the state but have increasingly made it clear that they still expect to be first in line when government offices are being handed out. The [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] on the other hand claim that the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] considers such appointments as mere rewards and will use them only to enrich themselves. Instead the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ argue we should appoint men out of individual merit.\nThe unexpected death of a trusted secretary has left a vacant position to be filled at the center of this conflict, with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ supporting one candidate and the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] expecting us to pick another. While both candidates are talented men this has to be a political decision."

 nobles_estate_events.11.d:0 "The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] have a long tradition of service to the state both as military leaders or more recently as dependable administrators. In a state where the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] are as strongly entrenched and loyal as ours this means that from time to time nobles of great talent and loyalty will emerge to lead the country to greatness."

 nobles_estate_events.13.d:0 "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the leaders of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] grow older our warm relations have grown colder. We need to make arrangements with the current breed of [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 burghers_estate_events.1.d:0 "The status of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ does not rest on the same old traditions as that of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by working diligently and then risking the profit to again expand their businesses. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control of the coins the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have managed to increase their power over our country."
 burghers_estate_events.2.d:0 "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are concerned with the great influence of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] in our state. They claim that many lower members of the nobility are disregarding the peace and law of the land, using their position of power and the lands they hold to take up unreasonable tolls and taxes for traders passing by. Some are even said to attack and waylay merchants, robbing or extorting them of their money.\nRepresentatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now claim that the economic development of our country is held back by these excesses. The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] on the other hand argue that they are simply charging reasonably for the use of their roads property. Some are willing to give the state a part of the share they take."

 dhimmi_estate_events.5.d:0 "Many among the Muslim [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] have been voicing complaints at what they feel is an unjust and unfair favoring of infidels in our government. Having sought the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ they now claim that we are running our country contrary to established Islamic customs and that we must ensure that the infidel are kept out of positions of influence.\nThe construction of a new shrine in a province largely dominated by the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ entirely funded by local nobles and merchants has escalated the situation further with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] demanding that we tear down the holy building and put the infidels in their place."
