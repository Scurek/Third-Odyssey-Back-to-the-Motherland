 canal_events.27.d:0 "Many claimed it was impossible. Other put it in the realm of the distant future, or of dreams, but [Root.Owner.GetName] put it in the realm of reality. Of ideas to connect two oceans, the Atlantic and the Eirenic always seemed the most distant, despite being separated by so little land. But through resilience, ingenuity and the sheer resources we have poured into the project, it has been completed, allowing our ships safe passage without the need to round Cape Horn. The canal, considered centuries ahead of its time, will not only serve as a gateway, but as a monument to the fact that nothing is impossible for [Root.Owner.GetName]."

First they tried to use the local population as slaves, but they quickly died out where that was tried. Slaves were then imported from Africa, which created a triangular trade system. Europe sold textiles, rum & manufactured goods to Africa, Africa sold slaves to Elysium, and Elysium sold cotton, sugar and tobacco to Europe."

While the new drink caught on quickly in some parts of [Root.GetAdjective] society it has taken some time, and large amounts of sugar, before it reached a larger acceptance. With that out of the way, however, the demand for chocolate is now steadily increasing in both the new and the old world."

For centuries India has been the only known source of Diamonds in the entire world, and even there it is only found in a few well guarded mining regions.\nWith the discovery of large quantities of diamonds in the new world, however, diamonds have become something not only for kings and princes, but also for rich magnates, burghers or other connoisseurs of jewelry."
