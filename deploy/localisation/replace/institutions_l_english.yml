 desc_global_trade:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of Elysium and Arkadia, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Eirenic Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere.  Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly global economy, but surely the first seeds have been sown."

 desc_feudalism:0 "Legalism is a simple concept. That concept upon which entire societies can be constructed, is that everyone is beholden to the Laws of the Land. To follow it is to be upstanding and good. To break the law is to be committing a betrayal against society itself and thus be entitled to punishment for it. Many civilised societies have in their time created extensive codified lists of laws, which they add to and amend as circumstances arise, and ultimately it is a mark of a truly civilised society to have a written law that all accept they must obey."
