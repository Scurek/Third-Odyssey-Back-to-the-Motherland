 culture_religion_events.2.db:0 "The ascension of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been less than well received by the [Root.Culture.GetName] people. They consider [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] manners foreign and strange. While some distrust to a new ruler is only natural it seems that for the time being our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will mostly have supporters at court, where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] surrounds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with [Root.new_ruler_culture.GetCultureName] friends from foreign lands."
 institution_events.3.da:0 "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonisers and the colonised. This has led to a spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vast size of the globe. Animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Eirenic the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy. As foreign lands and people are mapped and documented ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate has become more and more coloured by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth and from [From.GetCapitalName] to Fatehpur Sikri the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 institution_events.5.d:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of Elysium and Retoria, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Eirenic Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly global economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."

 EVTNAME4900:0 "Native Assimilation in $PROVINCENAME$"
 EVTDESC4900:0 "Some of the local natives have been assimilated into the colony's population. With the additional population, we have a lot more faith in the feasibility of $PROVINCENAME$."
 EVTDESC5058:0 "The privileges of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] have been under continuous assault as $MONARCH$ has attempted to centralize more and more control. The nobles have finally lost their patience and are demanding that they are given back what they believe is rightfully theirs."
 EVTDESC5064:1 "The [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] often prove unruly subjects of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], seeking to resist any infringement on their autonomy and seizing any opportunity to strengthen their position. This often includes making common cause with foreign powers. Recently, several key figures appear to have struck an agreement with [neighbour_country.GetUsableName] to advocate a pro-[neighbour_country.GetAdjective] course of action in return for certain favors and promises. While not directly treasonable, this behavior is clearly detrimental to our interests; however, reining them in is likely to prove no easy matter."
 EVTDESC5066:1 "Several members of the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] have come before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] with a proposal. Desperate for more lands and titles, they look with envy towards the [Root.GetClergyName], who own considerable land. They ask that we transfer church land to them in return for a large cash contribution to the [Root.GetStateForm]'s efforts. Of course, in the long term, we'd lose out on tax revenues from church lands in return for this short-term boost in revenue."
 EVTDESC5089:1 "One of the local [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] in [uppity_peasants_province.GetName] has so upset and mistreated his subjects that a delegation of peasants has come before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] to ask for redress. Agreeing to this would be popular with the peasantry but would be seen as an infringement on their authority by the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]."
 EVTNAME874:0 "Tensions between [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] and [Root.GetClergyName]"
 EVTDESC874:0 "In our nation two castes hold great power: the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] and the [Root.GetClergyName]. However, they do not always get along. Recently, a baron in [rebel_province.GetName] and the local monastery of his fief began bickering about who owns a rather large piece of land.\n\nThese days, the royal court is swamped with people yammering about divine right - the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName] claiming their divine right to rule the land and the [Root.GetClergyName] asserting their position as the representatives of God on Earth. The whole situation is growing rather unstable, with the baron in question inciting the other nobles against the [Root.GetClergyName] and questioning their right to hold any sort of temporal property. The prior of the monastery has brought in the archbishop on his side, who in turn threatens to go straight to Rome should you decide to side with the [Root.GetCorrectTONobilityName]. Now, what shall we do, my liege?"
 colonial.19.t:0 "Growth of the port of [colonial_19_target_province.GetName]"
 colonial.19.d:0 "The growth of our colony in [colonial_19_target_province.GetName] has always been closely associated with the Natural Harbor in the area and over time the province has come to act as something of a local trade hub.\nAs the settlement has grown so has the importance of its port. The settlement has come to act as the entrepôt for the entire region and foreign as well as local traders all go there to conduct their trade."
 colonial.19.a:0 "This must be the the result of our wise policies."
