 string_start_iroquois:0 "United under the Great Law of Peace by Hiawatha and the Great Peacemaker, the people of the Haudenosaunee confederacy have rapidly become one of the major power of North-Eastern North America. While the Oneida, Onondaga, and Cayuga tend to the needs of the confederacy, the Seneca in the west look toward the Great Lakes, a rich hunting ground ripe for expansion.\nMeanwhile to the east, the Mohawks eye the villages of the Saint Lawrence, wondering when the right time to claim those fertile and divided lands will be.\n\nIf the §YHaudenosaunee§! are to carry out their ambitions, they will need new weapons and new trading partners, but no one in the Americas now possess what they need..."
 string_start_huron:0 "Formed in time immemorial, by an alliance of four tribes living to the south of the lake that bear their name, the Wendat confederacy, or §YHuron§!, are a powerful league holding sway over trade in much of the lower great lake. The disparate Algonquin people to the west and north are too scattered to present a serious threat, and the only real menace to Huron prosperity come in the form of the rising power of the §YHaudenosaunee§! League, to the east, who will surely seek to wrest their trade from the Huron's hands."
 string_start_anishinaabe:0 "For generations, the ancestors of the Anishinaabe people have traveled westward, away from the coast of the Americas, hoping to escape the foreigners that their prophets claim will someday come over the sea.\nAt last, having reached the fifth stopping place in their exodus, where Lake Superior and Huron meet, they have divided into three great nations - Bodewadmic (or §YPotawatomi§!), Odaawaa (or §YOttawa§!) and §YOjibwe§! - and spread into the surrounding lands.\nStill bound by ties of culture and tradition, they face the threat of the growing power of the §YHuron§! and §YHaudenosaunee§! to the east, who may one day expand toward them..."
 string_start_osage:0 "A long and weary road, motivated by increasing §YHaudenosaunee§! aggression, has taken the Niukonska, or §YOsage§!, people along with their Dhegiha relative (the Quapaw, Kaw, Omaha and Ponca) from the eastern reaches of the Ohio river to the Ozark Mountains, and the Missouri. These powerful warriors have found relative safety in their new home, but as more and more tribes move westward in fear of Haudenosaunee power, that safety may soon be a thing of the past."
 string_start_tag_central_america:0 "Recent years have seen the rise of the §YAztec§! triple alliance in the valley of Mexico, while the §YTarascan§! empire has similarly started to expand their domain in the west. Further east, the Yucatan peninsula is home to the fractured remains of the Mayan Empire and the recently collapsed League of Mayapan."
 string_start_tag_north_america:0 "The last remnants of the ancient Mississippian civilization are dwindling, leaving behind remnant-states that will become the §YCreeks§!, §YChickasaw§! and §YChoctaw§!.\nIn the north, wandering prophets and leaders advocate for unity among the §YHaudenosaunee§! and the §YHurons§!, forming powerful confederacy that will shape the course of history."
