 to_a_world_empire_mission_desc:0 "The world, as we have learned by our mere presence in Elysium, is a very large place indeed. Some call for a return to the glorious days of old, when Rome's legions conquered half the known world in mere centuries. However, this doctrine has had its time and is no longer practical, as a new era of sail and cannon is dawning. A rapid expansion in the size of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy will allow us to extend our power well beyond our borders and reap the benefits of being a true world power."
 to_defender_of_the_faith_mission_desc:0 "We are not the only ones who have changed since our journey west. The treacherous schismatics have gained a new enemy, the so-called 'Protestants' - but the enemy of my enemy is not my friend, and they peddle mere lies of their own. Along with this, our old Orthodox brothers brand us heretics and have refused to see the truth of our new ways. Despite the resistance of these groups however, God knows the truth and has guided us from victory to victory against our foes. Many who once mocked us now join our ranks, and those that remain quake in fear of our might!\n\nThis is only the start. Soon enough, all of Christendom shall be united. And at last, all shall see the true word of God."
 to_elysia_ascendant_mission_desc:0 "Elysian soldiers march through old Rome! The green-and-gold colors of our flag fly all across Europe. The new world - the new Rome - has conquered the old! Our great labor has concluded; the great-great grandchildren of Aeneas have returned and reconquered a home that is no longer theirs. What follows is as important as the conquest, for we must shape Elysia and Europe alike into something more Elysian. An empire that, like Rome before it, shall never be forgotten through the mark it left on the world!\n\nRome did not last forever. But Elysia will."
 to_expanding_south_mission_desc:0 "We have grown mighty over the years, and now the time has come to put the lands of renegade Spartan Kingdom in its place. For too long they have ignored the authority of the [Root.GetAdjective] Emperor. No longer! We must unite the entire region under our heel, including any remaining Barbaroi tribes/kingdoms/etc, only then will its inhabitants accept our authority as the true rulers of the continent."
 to_looking_inwards_mission_desc:0 "[Root.GetInwardFocusDesc]"
 to_neither_holy_nor_roman_mission_desc:0 "The Patriarch of the West has never had the power to crown a Roman Emperor; that was always the domain of the Eastern Emperors - us. The Pope in Rome forgot that when he erroneously crowned Charles the Frank as 'Imperator Romanorum.'  The realm Charles the Frank created was never Roman, only 'holy' by the standards of the schismatics, and only occasionally approached being a true kingdom.\n\nIt is time we reminded the German pretenders of this. If they wish to call themselves the Roman Empire, they will do so only while bowing to us as their true Basileus."
 to_rome_restored_mission_desc:0 "Ever since we set forth from our old homelands, to sail forth and brave the unknown mysteries that lay beyond the horizon, we have spent every effort to build ourselves up, spurred on by the memories of our old greatness. When we returned to our rightful lands, and liberated them from the villainous Turks, it was as the saviours of the oppressed. The hearts of every man in our armies burned with a righteous passion to see our people restored to what they had once been, and with such fiendish vigour we carved through the petty kingdoms and empires that dared stand in our way like the barbarians of old.\n\nIt has been over a thousand years since Rome was last united. But today, at long last, that has finally changed. And as the last remaining inheritors to that old mantle, it is now within our power to create a civilisation that will last a thousand more.\n\nRome Restored! Rome Ascendant! Rome Eternal!"
