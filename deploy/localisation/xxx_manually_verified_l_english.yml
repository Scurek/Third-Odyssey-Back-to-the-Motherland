 roman_citizenship:0 "Roman Citizenship"
 roman_citizenship_desc:0 "Conquest requires an army. Army requires men. Men that our multi-continental Empire is short of. However, conquests also bring new people, many of whom are no less capable of fighting than our own. To that end a new edict shall be introduced: anyone willing to fight for Rome shall be granted citizenship and shall enjoy all the privileges enjoyed by their fellow citizens on Elysium. As long as our expansion continues apace our armies will no be found lacking recruits again.\n"

 to_idea_army_reform_desc:0 "A truly efficient army must be one that is lead intelligently, and supplied properly, but more than anything else must always be on the same page.\nThis is difficult however when there is no properly established code of military practice. After the lengthy campaigns across Elysium, against the Turks, and the rest of Europe after, we have amassed a horde of great generals who have proven their craft on the battlefield against many different foes.\nNow those generals are called on to join together and collaborate to create a book that shall serve as our ultimate manual to War, known if by all soldiers from the lowliest grunt to the general, and so every man in the entire army shall always know what is required of him at any time.\n"

 to_idea_imperial_bureacracy:0 "Imperial Bureaucracy"
 to_idea_imperial_bureacracy_desc:0 "Administering a vast empire composed of diverse provinces and cultures is a monumental task, requiring a strong and efficient chain of command, similar to that of our military. Our administration has carefully divided our lands into manageable administrative divisions, even taking into account our future conquests. To ensure a sufficient number of bureaucrats, schools have been established, where only the most loyal and capable individuals can progress. Those who succeed, however, will be rewarded with great honour and privilege, befitting of their importance to the Empire.\n"

 to_idea_cannon_foundries:0 "Batteries of Konstantinoupolis"
 to_idea_cannon_foundries_desc:0 "For all their shortcoming, the Rumites have always shown a fascination with siege-craft, as evidenced by the numerous cannon foundries found in Konstantinoupolis. There is no shame in learning from the enemy, and our military engineers have been working to revive these workshops and expand upon the knowledge they contain. Indeed, while our infantry is mighty, so will be our artillery, and while the Franks may take pride in building their castles and bastions, they will find them insufficient before the barrage of our batteries.\n"

 to_bureau_of_foreign_affairs:0 "Language of Conquest"
 to_bureau_of_foreign_affairs_desc:0 "While our own people have long moved onto using the far superior and more beautiful Greek, the majority of Christians in the old world still view Latin as the language of Rulership. Their Holy Bible is written exclusively in Latin, their priests and rulers learn Latin as a sign of their higher status, and their scholars learn Latin whenever they try to search back through time to reach the heights that Rome once reached.\nPutting this natural bias to our purposes is directly in our interests, and so our diplomats have begun to take instruction to speak solely in either Greek or Latin when dealing with conquered nobility, and relying on loyal translators for dealing with foreigners unable to talk back. In this way, we are spreading the use of Latin throughout the Old World as the language of Conquered peoples, and gradually establishing Greek as the Language of the Conquerors.\n"

 to_european_universities:0 "Academia Universalis"
 to_european_universities_desc:0 "Rome's enduring legacy lies not just in its military conquests, but also in its advancements in art, science, and philosophy. Across Europe, universities serve as centers of learning, places where the brightest minds innovate new ideas and inventions. Our Empire's finest scholars will continue to uphold our legacy as masters of engineering and architecture while incorporating these universities. With the knowledge at our fingertips and the best schools in Europe at our disposal, no scientific breakthrough or architectural marvel will be beyond our grasp, solidifying our Empire as the hub of civilization for all time.\n"

 to_idea_pax_romana_desc:0 "We stand victorious! Our vast military stands without peer, Europe is ours, and we have peace again. Our Empire stands on the precipice of a new golden age, another Pax Romana. The roads that once echoed with the clatter of marching legions now hum with the sounds of trade and commerce. Yet we must be vigilant, for the Imperial Peace of our ancestors did not last. We shall maintain a constant watch over this prosperity. Our navy will patrol the seas, protecting our merchants even in the farthest corners of the world, our spies will continue to report on our rivals, and the army will stand ready to defend our newfound peace. Pax Romana will not just be a state of affairs; but a philosophy that guides our rule, ensuring that every citizen of the Empire, from the lowliest farmer to the wealthiest merchant, can live their lives with dignity and security.\n"
