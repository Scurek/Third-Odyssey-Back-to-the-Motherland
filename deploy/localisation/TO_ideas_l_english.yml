 to_bureau_of_foreign_affairs_desc:0 "While our own people have long moved onto using the far superior and more beautiful Greek, the majority of Christians in the old world still view Latin as the language of Rulership. Their Holy Bible is written exclusively in Latin, their priests and rulers learn Latin as a sign of their higher status, and their scholars learn Latin whenever they try to search back through time to reach the heights that Rome once reached.\nPutting this natural bias to our purposes is directly in our interests, and so our diplomats have begun to take instruction to speak solely in either Greek or Latin when dealing with conquered nobility, and relying on loyal translators for dealing with foreigners unable to talk back. In this way, we are spreading the use of Latin throughout the Old World as the language of Conquered peoples, and gradually establishing Greek as the Language of the Conquerors.\n"
