 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.1.t:0 "Enhance Local Fortifications (I)"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.1.d:0 "Experience has taught us the importance of strong walls, which is why we're hardly ever pleased with the walls we've built. Constant additions and modifications turn our fortresses into mazes and strengthen them. Architects and engineers have prepared plans for strengthening the defences of one such fort and presented them to the Senate. The decision is left to the emperor by the senators, knowing full well the people value their defences and may lose faith in monarchs that do not recognise the near-sanctity of our walls."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.1.a:0 "Approve the plans. Further improvements may be proposed at a later date."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.1.b:0 "We can't afford this right now."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.1.c:0 "Convince the representatives of the area that they will never need more protection."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.2.a:0 "None will dare approach these walls! Further improvements may be proposed at a later date."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.3.a:0 "Our enemies shall break on our walls like waves on the cliffs! Further additions would hardly have effect."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.3.c:0 "Convince the representatives of the area that they will never need more protection."
 nhs_fort_enhance_no_longer_offered:0 "This province will no longer be able to upgrade fortifications above the current level."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.4.t:0 "Enhanced Fortifications Require Attention"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.4.d:0 "The complexity of our forts is both a strength and a weakness: it is difficult for besiegers to navigate and destroy the defences, but it also becomes more difficult to maintain or repair. Our traditions ensure this results in no extra cost, but when parts are forgotten or too much manpower had to leave to fight in the field a state of disrepair can occur. The near-sanctity of our fortifications means that poor maintenance reflects on our rulers."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.4.a:0 "Dispatch resources immediately!"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.4.b:0 "Our walls have no importance now. The populace will trust me, I'm sure of it."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.5.t:0 "Elysian Fortifications Crumble"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.5.d:0 "Without the know-how and garrison traditions to maintain the elaborate defences of the Elysians, their craftwork crumbles. Our army has salvaged whatever is useful from the expanded defences."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.5.a:0 "Let's see what they got me."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.6.t:0 "Elysia's Chosen Ones"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.6.d:0 "Garrison troops in our capital are gradually being replaced by the best troops from garrisons all over Elysia. While one may think this is to the detriment of our frontline defences, the rich compensation and prestigious status of our city's garrison has led to increased enlistment and motivates garrisons everywhere to train vigorously. The emperor has officially renamed $CAPITAL_CITY$'s guards to 'Epilektoi' ('The Chosen Ones') and selected the elite of the elite as bodyguards of the royal family and its household."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.6.a:0 "Institute the Epilektoi, by order of the Emperor!"

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.20.t:0 "Expanding the Senate of Cities"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.20.d:0 "We have acquired new territories that are not well integrated into our realm yet. Therefore, the important cities of the region have not had the rights our other cities do, like taking part in the Senate of Cities. If we were to extend this right to newly annexed cities, we could greatly increase the speed at which they are integrated into our society. Though they might be happy they are heard, that does not mean they no longer bear the wounds of a subjugated people, and such an addition would certainly complicate internal politics."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.20.a:0 "They'll be reasonable sooner rather than later."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.20.b:0 "We have no need for further complications."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.21.t:0 "City Senator Leaves Furious"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.21.d:0 "One of the debates in the Senate became very heated when a disgruntled city senator accused the Emperor of a lack of involvement in state affairs. It takes courage for a senator to say such a thing, but there isn't a lot that we can do about it. We could take care of these frustrations of his with some funds directed to him personally. If not, he might take this further and undermine our respect among his fellow citizens."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.21.a:0 "Let him go, no one will listen. I think."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.21.b:0 "Bribe him to remain quiet in public."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.22.t:0 "Senators Divided Over New Laws"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.22.d:0 "The Senate is divided over a new set of laws that would reduce the gap of wealth between the higher and lower classes. Debates like these happened even in Roman times - it has been attempted multiple times to redivide the lands of the wealthiest to the farmers impoverished by leaving their lands unattended during, for example, the Punic Wars. The situation is less dire today, but the issue remains and senators from cities that elect their representative through popular vote try to get re-elected by helping the large lower class. These populists have a point though, these laws would provide welcome relief to the unlucky families that try to make a living in this foreign, inhospitable land. Passing these laws would require us to bribe some of the wealthy senators as compensation for such measures. On the other hand, we could persuade those same senators to play it safe and bribe the Emperor to make sure the laws get vetoed if they'd somehow pass..."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.22.a:0 "Make sure the laws pass."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.22.b:0 "Accept bribes to block the laws."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.23.t:0 "Christian Senator Incites Conflict"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.23.d:0 "There are those in our country that damn us for not being loyal to one God, their God in particular. This narrow-minded cult of fanatics believing in a single God and blaspheming towards all other Gods has spread throughout our Empire - through conversion or conquest - and has no doubt invoked the wrath of all the Gods they blindly dismiss. They dismiss them without being able to prove their God even exists, no more than we can for ours if we're honest but at least we play it safe and please all Gods that have merit. Now a city senator from one of these Christian towns has insulted our Gods and damned all pious worshippers of our Pantheon. This has caused quite a bit of unrest in the Senate and the whole capital. People demand these blasphemers to be punished and made to worship all other Gods besides their own, like all proper citizens."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.23.a:0 "Leave the Christians to their own doings."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.23.b:0 "Ban Christians from holding public offices."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.23.c:0 "Persecute these cultists!"

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.24.t:0 "The Methods to Acquire Gunpowder"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.24.d:0 "We are finally in a position to acquire the secrets of modern firearm technology and tactics, either through espionage, diplomacy, or business. We cannot let the opportunity slip! Every day that goes by without this technology the threat from the Europeans grows larger. We will never be able to face them properly until we level the playing field."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.24.a:0 "Send undercover scholars and spies to Europe."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.24.b:0 "Send scholars to Elysia, where modern gunpowder is already known."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.24.c:0 "Send scholars to a friendly western nation."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.24.e:0 "Recruit foreign scientists with hard cash."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.24.f:0 "Appeal to our Orthodox brethren in Russia and Hellas."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.25.t:0 "Integrating the Albanians"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.25.d:0 "The Senate has discussed the issue and came up with a plan to integrate the Albanians into the Elysian society. Crucial to this plan is to interfere minimally with their own customs and traditions, lest they resist and return to their old ways entirely. This is also the weak point of the plan: our first attempts may fail to bring sufficient change. The Albanians have long lived together with the Elysians in our nation, but remained mostly isolated. Nonetheless, through contact with traders and by employing Hellenised natives, they came into contact with and have already integrated some of our language into their own. We will also fund local events that are Elysian in origin as well as their own, hoping they adopt some of our customs as well. Once they have opened up to us and seen our good will, the populace will certainly be more accepting towards further changes. The nobility is more resilient however, and may cause trouble or interfere with our plans."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.25.a:0 "This is currently not in our interest."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.25.b:0 "Attempt to integrate using our vassal as mediator."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.25.c:0 "Attempt to integrate the populace."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.30.t:0 "Natives Integrated in [Root.GetName]"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.30.d:0 "As in all Elysian provinces, colonists in [Root.GetName] have come to an understanding with the natives. Some of them trade with us, others helped us or were helped themselves. Many of them have adopted parts of our language, and now even marriages are not excluded! This is promising for the future of this province."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.30.a:0 "These are good people."

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.50.t:0 "Scouting the Frontier of [Root.GetName]"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.50.d:0 "Scouts have explored the territory surrounding our newly owned province, [Root.GetName]."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.50.a:0 "Let's see what they have to say."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.50.tt:0 "Discovers unknown neighbouring provinces"

 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.51.t:0 "Conquest of fellow Elysians"
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.51.d:0 "We have conquered lands from fellow Elysians. Scouting parties are currently organising to scout out surrounding provinces for unknown territory. They'll probably report back by the time we've taken full control of the province."
 nhs_elysIdeaEvents.51.a:0 "Very well, carry on."
