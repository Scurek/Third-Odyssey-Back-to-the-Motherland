 nhs_new_flightevents.1.d:0 "The emperor has been approached by his close confidante, Georgios Sphrantzes, who argues that we should take with us that this made us respected in ages past: our learning. The most important books and scrolls, including the manuscripts detailing the construction process for truly ocean-worthy vessels, should be collected into a library and given a place in the fleet. In addition, a skilled German engineer named Johannes Grandt was able to recreate Greek Fire on a limited scale based on scrolls stored in a hidden cache in the imperial library, and is requesting that space on the fleet be allotted to storing the substance and the ingredients used to make it. Such endeavors would be expensive and cost precious space, but they might be worth it."

Silk, he says, has long been the garment of royalty and empire, and would make a fine luxury trade good as well. Such would cost us precious space though, and we may need all the people and supplies we can get. At the very least, he requests that if we do not take the silk along, that we instead destroy it to prevent the Ottoman Sultanate from discovering its production methods."

The Republic of Venice is attempting to build an empire in the eastern Mediterranean, and they would be grateful for a hold over the strong defensive positions of the southern highlands. A delegation from the Republic of Genoa, headed by a certain Archbishop Leonard of Chios, has expressed a desire to increase their economic penetration of the Aegean and Black Seas - something that could easily be accomplished by selling the Despotate of the Morea to Genoa. Finally, we could grant direct independence to the Morean Despotate under the leadership of the emperor's brother, Theodoros."

The man, Orhan Çelebi, was never returned to the Ottoman Empire on the implied threat of execution for his grandfather's crimes. Needless to say, he fears such a punishment at the hands of his cousin, Mehmed, and has requested that a ship be allocated to him and his regiment of retainers. In return, he promises to train the Roman army, such as it is, in the advanced tactics of the feared Janissary corps, and also offers his personal service as a general in Roman service. In addition, a former Ottoman officer named Gjerj Kastrioti, called Skanderbeg, has rebelled from Turkish service and has travelled to the City in search of support. He has also learned of our impending flight and requests that some of his people be allowed on board. Unfortunately, there's only enough space left on our transports for one group: either Skanderbeg or Orhan Çelebi must stay behind in the doomed city.

One of our advisors suggested that we use this opportunity to trick the nations of Europe, making them believe that we were caught up in a series of increasingly treacherous storms filled with sea monsters and that our last act was to inform them. That way, it might take some generations before their curiosity returns. Alternatively, we could inform the Portuguese of our true intentions, providing us with a potential future ally in Europe."

The venerable scholar and philosopher, Gemistos Plethon, asked to see you, and you invited him into your quarters. He's a very learned man, renowned for his wisdom and knowledge, and he has served us as an imperial advisor in the past. So it seems strange that he of all men would suggest such a thing: return to worshipping the Old Gods, the Roman and Hellenic Gods. He says he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he states that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon. If there are Gods, he continued, they must be as flawed and ill-tempered as the old Hellenic Gods. We would do best to appease them, rather than speak to a God that may listen, but seems not to care."
