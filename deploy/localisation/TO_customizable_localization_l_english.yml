 string_start_byz_1444:0 "§YByzantium§!, the last remnant of the §YEastern Roman Empire§! and heir to over two thousand of years of Roman history and culture, is finally breathing its last breath. Surrounded on all sides by the §YOttoman Turkish§! menace and all but abandoned by the western powers, it would take a true miracle to save the last vestiges of Rome from destruction."
 string_start_ctm_1480:0 "After being separated from their §YRoman§! brethren during their crossing by the so-called 'Great Storm', the §YKaudans§! found themselves stranded on a small island they named Lanthanon Nisi or 'Lost Island'. The remaining survivors live off a meagre diet of fish and whatever supplies they salvaged from the wreckage, but will not last long."
 string_start_elysia_1480:0 "§YElysia§! has now established itself as a local powerhouse, with a loyal army protecting its major cities, and a small but powerful navy guarding its coasts. However, a large majority of the population currently resides in or around the capital, §YNew§! §YConstantinople§!, a situation many see as a strategic weakness. If it is to truly thrive, Elysia must cross the §YAppalachian§! §YMountains§! to the west and settle the lands beyond.\n\nAs the Elysian frontier moves further inland, many of the smaller §YBarbaroi§! tribes are banding together for mutual defence, with the most recent of these federations calling themselves the \"Haudenosaunee\" or §YIroquois§!. Seeking an ally amongst the natives, the Emperor has married his youngest daughter to the Haudenosaunee Chief, known as §YTheyanoguin§!. Though the alliance remains stable for now, the Elysian conversion of Theyanoguin and several high-ranking Haudenosaunee Chieftains has angered many Barbaroi who feel that their leaders are abandoning the ways of their ancestors.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent discovery of the §YKykladian Islands§! to the south provides Elysia's merchants with exciting new trade opportunities, as the establishment of trade outposts in the region will help strengthen trade and communication networks with the §YSpartans§! while also allowing the Emperor to keep a closer eye on them.\n\nThe §YAlbanians§! remain a minority culture within our realm and are content to isolate themselves inside their fortified settlements, though how long this will last remains to be seen.\n\nFinally, the Viking colonies of §YMarkland§! and §YHelluland§! have united under a single banner to form the nation of §YVinland§!. With their combined strength, the Norsemen are once again free to raid the Elysian coastline."
 string_start_hll_1444:0 "§YHelluland§!, one of the two Norse colonies in §YVinland§!, was established by the legendary Viking explorer §YThorfinn Karlsefni§! almost five centuries ago. Helluland, along with §YMarkland§!, is now the world's last vestige of old Norse culture and religion - the inexorable advance of the Cross having taken Scandinavia. Vinland, once isolationist and stagnant, is now poised to undergo a new age of upheaval as ships are sighted on the eastern horizon for the first time in centuries."
 string_start_mrk_1444:0 "§YMarkland§!, one of the two Norse colonies in §YVinland§!, was established by the legendary Viking explorer §YLeif Eriksson§! almost five centuries ago. Markland, along with §YHelluland§!, is now the world's last vestige of old Norse culture and religion - the inexorable advance of the Cross having taken Scandinavia. Vinland, once isolationist and stagnant, is now poised to undergo a new age of upheaval as ships are sighted on the eastern horizon for the first time in centuries."
 string_start_sparta_1480:0 "In the years since their landing, the Spartans have managed to create a small but powerful kingdom situated along the coast between Elysium and Arkadia, known as §YSpartakon§!. During this initial conquest, countless §YBarbaroi§! natives were absorbed into the state as auxiliary warriors or as slaves, with a lucky few allowed to keep their noble privileges intact. As a result a careful balance must be struck between pleasing the Spartan-born §YApogonoi§! and the native §YPipiltin§! nobility.\n\n§YLeonidas§!, the self-styled 'King of Sparta' and younger brother to the reigning §YElysian Emperor§!, is hoping to expand further inland in order to secure his position. A coalition of native empires led by the §YAztecs§!, known as the §YJaguar§! §YLeague§! , have managed to put aside their past differences and declare war on the expanding Spartakon nation in the hopes of ridding their lands of the warmongering foreigners once and for all.\n\nIf Spartakon is able to unite the §YAztec§! and §YMayan§! lands under one banner and deal with its internal troubles, the Spartan armies could no doubt give the Elysian legions a run for their money!"
 string_start_vinland_1480:0 "After engaging in centuries of petty but ultimately indecisive conflict, the 'lost' Viking colonies of §YHelluland§! and §YMarkland§! have united under a single banner, though at the cost of countless Viking warriors and nobles on both sides. To ensure that such a conflict never occurs again, the Jarls have agreed to return to the governing assemblies of their ancestors, the Althing, thereby allowing all Norse freemen to solve their differences through words rather than conflict. With the civil war now behind them, the §YVikings of Vinland§! are free to focus on expanding further into §YSkraeling§! territory, or maybe even raid §YElysian§! shipping."

He set out from Europe intent on finding the way all the way East to India, in his effort to prove the roundness of the Earth. What he found instead was us, and the flourishing Elysium we have built. He returned to Europe with our exotic goods and Barbaroi slaves, and became renowned as the first trader to cross the Atlantic. But his dream of sailing West to India was never fulfilled.\n\nTo complete his journey and accomplish his dream, we will need to cross the Eirenic ocean, the largest and most unexplored stretch of water known to civilised man. To others this might be intimidating, but we are [GetElysiansRomans]. We crossed the Atlantic with a fleet larger than the world has ever seen, and since Columbus' voyage, our mariners have truly mastered the crossing of the Atlantic ocean, sailing from [950.GetName] to as far flung ports as Archangelsk. If there are any people who can complete the voyage across the Eirenic, it is [GetElysiansRomans]."

And yet the Eirenic remains an almost undiscovered country.\n\nAn Italian Sailor known as Christopher Columbus believed that the world was round, and that by sailing west you can reach the far east and acquire the many riches of Asia, but our flight left Europe unenthused with the idea of sailing westwards. Now, the potential remains. We shall sail west to reach the east, and if the markets of Asia are to be found, we shall seize them with both hands."

Careful Rationing and foraging what we could from the land have been able to sustain us for some time.\n\nBut now finally those measures can be done away with. With careful help from more friendly natives, we have come to tame this land and know it just as well as we did our old. Irrigation ditches have been dug and fertile fields are now overflowing with the first of our new crops just waiting for the harvest. A year of plenty is upon us now, and we can only hope for many more to come."
