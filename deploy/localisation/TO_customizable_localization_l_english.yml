 string_start_byz_1444:0 "§YByzantium§!, the last remnant of the §YEastern Roman Empire§! and heir to over two thousand of years of Roman history and culture, is finally breathing its last breath. Surrounded on all sides by the §YOttoman Turkish§! menace and all but abandoned by the western powers, it would take a true miracle to save the last vestiges of Rome from destruction."
 string_start_ctm_1480:0 "After being separated from their §YRoman§! brethren during their crossing by the so-called 'Great Storm', the §YKaudans§! found themselves stranded on a small island they named Lanthanon Nisi or 'Lost Island'. The remaining survivors live off a meagre diet of fish and whatever supplies they salvaged from the wreckage, but will not last long."
 string_start_elysia_1480:0 "§YElysia§! has now established itself as a local powerhouse, with a loyal army protecting its major cities, and a small but powerful navy guarding its coasts. However, a large majority of the population currently resides in or around the capital, §YNew§! §YConstantinople§!, a situation many see as a strategic weakness. If it is to truly thrive, Elysia must cross the §YAppalachian§! §YMountains§! to the west and settle the lands beyond.\n\nAs the Elysian frontier moves further inland, many of the smaller §YBarbaroi§! tribes are banding together for mutual defence, with the most recent of these federations calling themselves the \"Haudenosaunee\" or §YIroquois§!. Seeking an ally amongst the natives, the Emperor has married his youngest daughter to the Haudenosaunee Chief, known as §YTheyanoguin§!. Though the alliance remains stable for now, the Elysian conversion of Theyanoguin and several high-ranking Haudenosaunee Chieftains has angered many Barbaroi who feel that their leaders are abandoning the ways of their ancestors.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent discovery of the §YKykladian Islands§! to the south provides Elysia's merchants with exciting new trade opportunities, as the establishment of trade outposts in the region will help strengthen trade and communication networks with the §YSpartans§! while also allowing the Emperor to keep a closer eye on them.\n\nThe §YAlbanians§! remain a minority culture within our realm and are content to isolate themselves inside their fortified settlements, though how long this will last remains to be seen.\n\nFinally, the Viking colonies of §YMarkland§! and §YHelluland§! have united under a single banner to form the nation of §YVinland§!. With their combined strength, the Norsemen are once again free to raid the Elysian coastline."
 string_start_hll_1444:0 "§YHelluland§!, one of the two Norse colonies in §YVinland§!, was established by the legendary Viking explorer §YThorfinn Karlsefni§! almost five centuries ago. Helluland, along with §YMarkland§!, is now the world's last vestige of old Norse culture and religion - the inexorable advance of the Cross having taken Scandinavia. Vinland, once isolationist and stagnant, is now poised to undergo a new age of upheaval as ships are sighted on the eastern horizon for the first time in centuries."
 string_start_mrk_1444:0 "§YMarkland§!, one of the two Norse colonies in §YVinland§!, was established by the legendary Viking explorer §YLeif Eriksson§! almost five centuries ago. Markland, along with §YHelluland§!, is now the world's last vestige of old Norse culture and religion - the inexorable advance of the Cross having taken Scandinavia. Vinland, once isolationist and stagnant, is now poised to undergo a new age of upheaval as ships are sighted on the eastern horizon for the first time in centuries."
 string_start_sparta_1480:0 "In the years since their landing, the Spartans have managed to create a small but powerful kingdom situated along the coast between Elysium and Arkadia, known as §YSpartakon§!. During this initial conquest, countless §YBarbaroi§! natives were absorbed into the state as auxiliary warriors or as slaves, with a lucky few allowed to keep their noble privileges intact. As a result a careful balance must be struck between pleasing the Spartan-born §YApogonoi§! and the native §YPipiltin§! nobility.\n\n§YLeonidas§!, the self-styled 'King of Sparta' and younger brother to the reigning §YElysian Emperor§!, is hoping to expand further inland in order to secure his position. A coalition of native empires led by the §YAztecs§!, known as the §YJaguar§! §YLeague§! , have managed to put aside their past differences and declare war on the expanding Spartakon nation in the hopes of ridding their lands of the warmongering foreigners once and for all.\n\nIf Spartakon is able to unite the §YAztec§! and §YMayan§! lands under one banner and deal with its internal troubles, the Spartan armies could no doubt give the Elysian legions a run for their money!"
 string_start_vinland_1480:0 "After engaging in centuries of petty but ultimately indecisive conflict, the 'lost' Viking colonies of §YHelluland§! and §YMarkland§! have united under a single banner, though at the cost of countless Viking warriors and nobles on both sides. To ensure that such a conflict never occurs again, the Jarls have agreed to return to the governing assemblies of their ancestors, the Althing, thereby allowing all Norse freemen to solve their differences through words rather than conflict. With the civil war now behind them, the §YVikings of Vinland§! are free to focus on expanding further into §YSkraeling§! territory, or maybe even raid §YElysian§! shipping."

 nhs2_shock_events.1.elysianhellenic:0 "In fact, we can hardly be recognized as one people any more. We have rediscovered the truth of the Divine, and founded a prosperous culture many miles across the ocean, while the Greeks have been left to rot in their ignorance and occupation.\n\nOur wisdom and enlightenment are seemingly pure anathema to the Greeks, who have greeted us as barbarous invaders, if not demonic interlopers. Already, they are proving as stubborn an enemy as their previous occupiers, and find ourselves fighting the very people we came to liberate.\n\nNeedless to say, something must be done if this invasion is to succeed in anything other than wasting Elysia's resources."
 nhs2_shock_events.1.elysianorthodox:0 "Because while the Greeks were left behind to rot under foreign conquerors, we Elysians have forged a new realm, a new culture, far from this once familiar shores.\n\nAlready, the communication difficulties between our legions, particularly the native and Norse regiments, are becoming readily apparent. This, along with the Elysian customs we bring from our shores, has made the Greeks wary of us."
 nhs2_shock_events.1.romanhellenic:0 "Because while we rediscovered the true Gods, our brethren yet cling to our old monotheistic ways. While at first welcoming, with our language not too different from theirs, the revelation of our new divine allegiances soon changed their tune for the drastically worse.\n\nNow, we are eyed with suspicion within our own homelands, our soldiers refused lodging without payment or coercion. The rift this has put between us and our Greek Brothers cannot be understated, and how we chose to deal with it will decide the fate of not just our Empire, but our Faith."
 nhs2_shock_events.1.romanorthodox:0 "Fortunately, it seems the differences are negligible, likely owing to our fierce refusal to give up our traditions. Already, our soldiers are ingratiating themselves with the local populace, the language barrier all but non-existent.\n\nUnited by language, religion, and soon, purpose, the Greeks are welcoming us as the long-lost brethren that we are. That being said, there are still differences, many of which are yet to be discovered. Our decisions in dealing with these discoveries will likely decide the fate of the Roman peoples for decades to come."
