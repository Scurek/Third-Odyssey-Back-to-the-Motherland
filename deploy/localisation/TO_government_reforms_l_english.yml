 senatorial_empire_desc:0 "A government led by a hereditary emperor, but with substantial power given to the nobles and provincial governors who comprise the senate. With senators formerly only drawn from the oldest families and now also called from every city, the mob can follow politicians that they actually know and feel that they too have a voice in the running of the state, as even a wealthy commoner might rise through the administration to become a governor or a senator. Such delegation of power does provide for a far greater wealth of experience and a well-governed empire is its own reward."

As the orders expanded, they also took an ever-increasing role in organizing various celebrations, honoring the local patron Deities.\n\nNow the orders present a perfect candidate to be bestowed the honor of organizing the largest of festivals, an obligation previously carried by various local officials. Not only would this remove plenty of needless bureaucracy, but the competition between orders from various cities would also serve to further motivate the organizers to present a splendid performance worthy of the Gods above."
