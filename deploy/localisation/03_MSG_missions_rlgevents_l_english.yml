 msg_expand_zone_of_control_desc:0 "Our position in this land is tenuous at best. Should the natives rally their forces and attack us we would be exterminated in one fell swoop. We need to advance the borders to prevent this."

 msg_demoralize_enemy_desc:0 "A city between here and the famed Aztec capital is of great importance to the natives. Conquering it would show them our superiority."
 msg_conquer_mexico_title:0 "Conquer the Mexican Valley"
 msg_conquer_mexico_desc:0 "The cities in the Valley of Mexico, as the barbaroi call it, are a great power center to the region - and serve as a rival to the rule of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Subjugation of the region will bring our control to the other side of Lakonya."
 msg_conquer_far_west_title:0 "Conquer the Tarascan"
 msg_conquer_far_west_desc:0 "Our subjugation of the northwest of this land is near complete. The only remaining empires that can contest our rule are those in the far west, beyond the Valley. The Tarascan and Colima must be crushed, before they can rally the other natives and destroy us."
 msg_secure_southern_coast_title:0 "Secure a Southern Coast"
 msg_secure_southern_coast_desc:0 "Our interpreters tell us that the natives know of two coastlines - one that we arrived from, and one on the far side of this land. Let us acquire a port on the other side."

 msg_conquer_otomi_title:0 "Conquer the Otomi Tribes"
 msg_conquer_otomi_desc:0 "The primitive tribes to the south of Lakonya can still cut of our supply lines between the Aztec lands and the Maya kingdoms. At any rate their subjugation will not be difficult."
 msg_secure_peninsula_title:0 "Northern Ports"
 msg_secure_peninsula_desc:0 "The northern portion of the Mayan peninsula are the closest geographically to the Elysian mainland. While this land is rich in gold and cocoa, the sad fact is that gold makes a poor construction material. Trade with Elysia will be vital in the early days - and a port in the north will assist us in doing so."
 msg_enter_the_jungle_title:0 "Enter the Jungle"
 msg_enter_the_jungle_desc:0 "The largely tribal Mayan peninsula has the most difficult terrain the Spartan army has encountered thus far. It will take major tactical reform to battle in this land, but we must persevere if we wish to survive in this new land."
 msg_profitable_exports_title:0 "Gem Exports"
 msg_profitable_exports_desc:0 "In Otomi lands there is a mine that produces blood-red opals, and in the Mayan territories jade is dug from the earth. Securing these mines will diversify our exports, and help prevent rampant inflation."

 msg_finish_reforms_desc:0 "Political, social, economic, and religious upheaval are taking place in Lakonya as a direct result of the Spartan conquest. We must remain vigilant, and balance the interests of each involved party if the Spartan state should survive this turbulent time. An army brought us this power, but it will take wit and silver tongue to keep it."

 msg_go_north_desc:0 "The mountainous lands to the north are inhabited by the Chichimec tribes, which much like the barbarian Odoacer, had arrived in Lakonya centuries ago and sacked the city of Tollan. Unless we wish to repeat history, we should secure this unruly northern border."
 msg_conquer_pueblo_title:0 "Conquer the Anasazi Tribes"
 msg_conquer_pueblo_desc:0 "Contact with Dine'e traders has told us of a reclusive civilization to the north known as the Anasazi. Once they held a thriving sedentary nation, now they lay divided and weak. \"Conquest\" may be a generous term, but further northern expansion will surely benefit the Spartan people..."
 msg_go_south_title:0 "An Army, A Plan, A Colony"
 msg_go_south_desc:0 "Our explorers tell us that further south, the distance between the coasts thins dramatically, to the point where a canal could be conceivably built. Disease and muddy weather may prevent us from doing so in the near future, but it is better to secure the territory than let anyone else do it."
 msg_into_south_america_title:0 "Into Retoria"
 msg_into_south_america_desc:0 "The Portuguese colonies in Retoria are expanding, and before long they will expand into Lakonya proper. A foothold in Retoria puts us in a position to fight the Europeans, should the worst happen."

 msg_join_aztlan_title:0 "Follow the True Gods"

 msg_wipe_out_hellenic_desc:0 "The people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have been enlightened by the Creed, but those in the countryside and beyond our borders remain ignorant to the True Faith.

 msg_incite_barbaroi_rebellion_desc:0 "Our allies have made inroads with Barbaroi in Elysia that haven't fully forgotten their identity or former allegiance. With some arms and a little coercion, they would be willing to rise against their tyrants when the time is right."

 msg_purchase_varangian_mercenaries_desc:0 "The Varangian Guard itself is loyal to the Elysians, but that doesn't mean the citizens they control are. If we were to bribe some local leader and \"suggest\" that they should cause trouble in Elysia at the right time, they could provide an excellent distraction."
 msg_skythian_line_title:0 "Skythian Line"
 msg_skythian_line_desc:0 "Fortifications can be difficult to construct on this matted grassland, but the nomadic hordes won't wait for us to reach better climes before attacking. Fortunately the sheer cliffs in Anasazi territory will provide our architects with plenty of raw material."

 msg_barbaroi_spartan_officers_desc:0 "The armies of the native tribes are woefully insufficient. If we send some of our retired officers to the tribes, we could instruct them on better means of warfare. Our advisors assure us that there will be no unintended consequences from this act, at all."
 msg_into_kyklades_title:0 "Into the Kyklades"
 msg_into_kyklades_desc:0 "Elysian settlers from their island puppet are flooding into the Kyklades. While our officers disdain spending any more than necessary on a navy, the fact of the matter is that we will need naval superiority to effectively fight the Elysians. Settlement of the Kykladian isles will provide us with both ports and raw materials in the form of Tropical Wood."
 msg_viking_pact_title:0 "The Varangian Pact"
 msg_viking_pact_desc:0 "The \"Varangian Pact\" is one proposal for gaining allies against Elysia, should the worst happen.

 msg_mission.7.d:0 "Our settlement of the northeast, past the Great River, has brought us to a most remarkable land. \n\nPerhaps this is an exaggeration, as anything would look good to a settler after nearly a month of trekking through desert, but nevertheless the river-run plains of the Northeast are attractive to farmers. The matted grasslands, however, have proven difficult to construct on - however, our settlement of the Anasazi province further west provides the new settlers with heavy stone, which serves as a better foundation. \n\nEven more curiously, the tribes are quite agreeable and have moved in to our colonial towns. They call our settlers \"taysha\", or friends, which our settlers have even taken to refer to themselves."
 msg_mission.7.a:0 "Interesting..."
 msg_mission.8.t:0 "The Lone Star Legion"
 msg_mission.8.d:0 "There was one unforeseen problem with plainsward expansion: the frequency of Skythian raids. One particularly harrowing tale is that of a temple in eastern Tayshia which was beset by raiders. The garrison killed nearly three times their number before the natives pulled back - and burned the temple to the ground. Having had enough, a prominent Apogonoi in the region assembled the various garrisons, militias, and some veteran soldiers into what he calls the Lone Star Legion. \n\nThis Legion is unusual in many ways. It was never cleared for formation by Neo Sparta for one, and its recruitment standards are rather slack. However, unlike the other legions the Lone Star Legion's primary objectives are defence of Tayshia and, by extension, Lakonya as a whole from the Skythians. This is accomplished by armed patrols along major trade routes, effective training of garrisons, and so-called Rangers touring the boundary between Spartan settlements and native lands. This means that the new Legion is quite stationary and not up to the standards of the rest of our army. However, their effectiveness against raiders has earned them a lot of popularity among the settlers."

 msg_mission.9.t:0 "Province of Retoria Major"
 msg_mission.9.d:0 "Past the jungles of Retoria (now called Retoria Minor) is a great bay facing the Kyklades, which our citizens are starting to settle. \n\n The vast expanse of savannah dotted by rainforests is a sight to behold, which has made the region an attractive destination. Since the land is not nearly as rough as that of Retoria Minor, we can expect more development to take place here in the future. The nearby bay, which the natives call Maaraiwo, in particular provides a ring around which major settlements could be built and linked to the rest of Sparta, or perhaps the Kyklades themselves."
 msg_mission.9.a:0 "Interesting..."
 msg_mission.10.t:0 "The Port City of Gythion"
 msg_mission.10.d:0 "Our timid settlement of the Kyklades was motivated by one main concern: the Elysian navy. Lakonya proper has a dearth of harbours both natural and man-made, and very little expertise in shipbuilding. Thus, settlement in the Kyklades would provide us with the shorelines necessary to construct more harbours, with which to build a navy that could compete with the Elysian navy. \n\nThis idea has really taken with the settlers of Gythion, whom are mostly shipwrights experienced in constructing fishing vessels. A harbour is already under construction in Gythion, with optimistic new plans for a grand Spartan navy, based in the new province. This is obviously a few years away, but it's good to see that there is now some enthusiasm in the idea."
