 nhs2_shock_events.1.t:0 "Old Home, New Differences"
 nhs2_shock_events.1.d:0 "It has been many decades since we sailed from Constantinople on our Great Odyssey to Elysia. Now that we are back, it is clear that we and the Greeks left behind are no longer entirely the same peoples.\n\n[Root.nhs_2_shock_events_1_desc]"
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_romanorthodox:0 "Fortunately, it seems the differences are negligible, likely owing to our fierce refusal to give up our traditions. Already, our soldiers are ingratiating themselves with the local populace, the language barrier all but non-existent.\n\nUnited by language, religion, and soon, purpose, the Greeks are welcoming us as the long-lost brethren that we are. That being said, there are still differences, many of which are yet to be discovered. Our decisions in dealing with these discoveries will likely decide the fate of the Roman peoples for decades to come."
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.a:0 "Rome is Home"
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_elysianorthodox:0 "Because while the Greeks were left behind to rot under foreign conquerors, we Elysians have forged a new realm, a new culture, far from these once familiar shores.\n\nAlready, the communication difficulties between our legions, particularly the native and norse regiments, are becoming readily apparent. This, along with the Elysian customs we bring from our shores, have made the Greeks wary of us."
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.b:0 "We'll get them up to speed."
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_romanhellenic:0 "Because while we rediscovered the true Gods, our brethren yet cling to our old monotheistic ways. While at first welcoming, with our language not too different from theirs, the revalaiton of our new divine allegiances soon changed their tune for the drastically worse.\n\nNow, we are eyed with suspicion within our own homelands, our soldiers refused lodging without payment or coercion. The rift this has put between us and our Greek Brothers cannot be understated, and how we chose to deal with it will decide the fate of not just our Empire, but our Faith."
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.c:0 "Our Brothers will see the light."
 nhs_2_shock_events_1_elysianhellenic:0 "In fact, we can hardly be recognized as one people any more. We have rediscovered the truth of the Divine, and founded a prosperous culture many miles across the ocean, while the Greeks have been left to rot in their ignorance and occupation.\n\nOur wisdom and enlightenment is seemingly pure anathema to the Greeks, who have greeted us as barbarous invaders, if not demonic interlopers. Already, they are proving as stubborn an enemy as their previous occupiers, and find ourselves fighting the very people we came to liberate.\n\nNeedless to say, something must be done if this invasion is to succeed in anything other than wasting Elysia's resources"
 nhs_2_shock_events.1.d:0 "They better start behaving..."

 to_cultureshock_vlight_tt:0 "Our Greek brethren are welcoming us with open arms, but it will still take a while to get used to our new differences."
 to_cultureshock_light_tt:0 "The Greeks are welcoming us, albeit it with slight waryness. They will be less enthusiastic about signing up for the legions, and paying their taxes."
 to_cultureshock_medium_tt:0 "The Greeks are hesitant in welcoming us back owing to our cultural differences, which will hinder their integration."
 to_cultureshock_bad_tt:0 "Our Greek brethren are outraged at our ways, we should be careful, or risk them openly turning against us."
 to_cultureshock_vbad_tt:0 "The Greeks are outraged at our ways, and have already turned against our liberation armies. The slightest spark will ignite open revolution."
 
 nhs2_shock_events.51.t:0 "Elysian Patriarch Welcomed!"
 nhs2_shock_events.51.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, our Greek subjects have welcomed our deposing of the previous Ecumenical Patriarch with open arms!\n\nYears of Turkish meddling had apparently rotted away the Patriarch's independence and he had become little more than a puppet of the Mohammedans. As such, our replacement has surprisingly become the more impartial and autonomous candidate."
 nhs2_shock_events.51.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
 nhs2_cultureshock_critical.tt:0 "This will push the Greeks past the treshhold!"
 nhs2_cultureshock_solved.tt:0 "This will finally put the Greeks at ease for good!"
 nhs2_shock_events.52.t:0 "Elysian Patriarch Rejected!"
 nhs2_shock_events.52.d:0 "As was expected, the Greeks are not at all happy with our deposing of their Ecumenical Patriarch, and it is being viewed as a heretical infringement on the divine rights of the Patriarch to shepherd his flock.\n\nNeedless to say, this will have negative effects on our standing with our Greek subjects."
 nhs2_shock_events.52.a:0 "Drat..."

 nhs2_shock_events.60.t:0 "New World Nobles, Old World Claims"
 nhs2_shock_events.60.d:0 "A gathering of nobles have come to the court of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a concerning matter. They claim that several of their ancestor's ancestral estates back in Greece are technically their rightful property through the laws of inheritance, and now demand that these lands be returned to them. While they may technically be right, evicting the current owners is sure to upset the Greek populace greatly, potentially harming our ability to govern them.\n\nThe nobles are not coming empty-handed however, as many of the rule over considerable demesnes themselves. They promise that if their lands should be returned to them, they will use their personal armies to solidify [Root.GetAdjective] control over the lands affected. Denying them outright will definetely upset our court, as the nobility's claims are somewhat legitimate, so even if we reject their initial proposition, it might be wise to come up with a compromise."
 nhs2_shock_events.60.a:0 "It is theirs by right."
 nhs2_shock_events.60.b:0 "Surely we can spare some Crown conquests?"
 nhs2_shock_events.60.c:0 "Didn't we just evict a bunch of Turks?"
 nhs2_shock_events.60.e:0 "They gave up that land when they left Greece."

 nhs2_shock_events.65.t:0 "The Greedy Guilds and Greece"
 nhs2_shock_events.65.d:0 "Our rapid conquests in Europe have lead to the simultaneous conquest of several valuable trade cities and ports. In the haste of our advance, we have not set down any proper trade laws, and this unintentional laiszes-faire policy coupled with the influx of cheap, exotic goods from Elysia have lead to an unexpectededly rapid economic resurgence in these lands. Needless to say, the locals are already starting to treat this policy as the norm, and are praising us for it.\n\nThis enthusiasm is not echoed by the Elysian merchant guilds however, who are complaining about the price of their goods being driven down by the fierce competition. Of course, they also complain about the immense difficulty in driving out the local merchants and making their own inroads in the conquered provinces. They propose that we enforce the national tarrifs on the European provinces as well, to force the local merchants to deal with the [Root.GetAdjective] merchants first.\n\nThe local merchants themselves have come with their own proposition, which is a sort of opposite situation, where our new demesne in Europe will become the sole importer of Elysian goods to the Old World. This would greatly enrich our new subjects, but will obviously upset our established merchant class as well as negatively impact our trade relations with established partners.\n\nWe could of course just make the current situation permanent."
 nhs2_shock_events.65.a:0 "They're [Root.GetAdjective], [Root.GetAdjective] laws apply."
 nhs2_shock_events.65.b:0 "They're [Root.GetAdjective], they naturally get first pick of [Root.GetAdjective] goods."
 nhs2_shock_events.65.c:0 "The current situation works for us, enshrine it in law."

 nhs2_shock_events.101.t:0 "The Parthenon"
 nhs2_shock_events.101.d:0 "Following our return to Europe, an interesting discovery has been made. A Marian Church, converted by the Turks to a mosque, has revealed itself to be an ancient temple to Athena, goddess of War and Wisdom. Many of our most prominent philosophers and oracles have stated that restoring the temple to its former glory and purpose would surely grant us much favour in the many wars to come, but this suggestion is not without its problems.\n\nWhile the Turks using it a mosque have already been evicted, our Greek subjects have already begun using it as a Church of Christ again. Letting them continue to do so, or even helping them renovate it as such, would surely go a long way in proving our benevolent intentions. This would not exactly do wonders for the legitimacy of our faith however, and would discourage new converts.\n\nAlternatively, we could always force the Greeks to share the site with their new Hellenic neighbours, something their religion encourages, no?"
 nhs2_shock_events.101.a:0 "Surely we can share?"
 nhs2_shock_events.101.b:0 "Renovate it to its true purpose."
 nhs2_shock_events.101.c:0 "Let them keep it, and help them maintain it."

 nhs2_shock_events.105.t:0 "The Hagia Sophia"
 nhs2_shock_events.105.d:0 "Few buildings are as big of a sore spot for our new subjects as the Hagia Sophia. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks, it has been refurbished into a mosque for the Muhammedans to use, and the Christians have been left without their - admittedly very beautiful - cathedral, much to their dismay. With our reconquest of the city, we therefore have an exceptional opportunity to please our Greek subjects, by giving them back control of their precious holy site. They will no doubt tear down many of the Turkish additions to the building, which will upset our Turkish subjects, so it is not without its risks.\n\nSome of our more belligerent oracles have, however, come to us with an... interesting proposition. They say that the building is a profane defilement of our ancestral lands by the Abrahamics, and that we should therefore raze the thing to the ground as a grand offering to the Gods for their favor. Needless to say, this will greatly upset all of our European neighbours, but it would make for a fierce display of power.\n\nIn the end, the choice is up to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 nhs2_shock_events.105.a:0 "Make them share, we can't risk upsetting any of our subjects."
 nhs2_shock_events.105.b:0 "Give it back to the Christians."
 nhs2_shock_events.105.c:0 "§R'Tis a worthy offering...§!"
