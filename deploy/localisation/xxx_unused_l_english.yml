 ELYREVDESC01:0 "Ever since the Emperor abolished the Elysian Senate, unrest has been festering throughout the Empire. Large groups across Elysia have been seen advocating for restrictions to be placed upon the Emperor's powers, and for greater rights and powers to be granted to the various peoples of the Empire. While the Presbyteroi have thrown their full support behind [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Dynatoi appear to be split between supporting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and, unthinkably, establishing a republic, in which the Dynatoi can hold considerably more power under puppet rulers. Upon hearing this, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] immediately demanded that these disloyal noblemen be apprehended and dragged before him, despite the fact that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors warn that this could very well be the spark that ignites the powder keg and plunges the Empire into civil war."

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC20:0 "Since its founding, Vinland's expansion has been haphazard, usually in the wake of an impromptu war against a native tribe or some adventurer taking it upon himself to found a new village. However, new legislation recently passed in the Althing would change that.

Graciously greeted by the natives, he learned that this faraway land is known as the Iroquois Confederacy, a union of nations bound together by an unwritten constitution known as the Great Law of Peace. The Haudenosaunee there extend their hand in friendship, wishing to know us better."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC41:0 "When we first discovered the Iriquios, several of the explorer's followers stayed behind to set up small settlements on the fringes of the Confederacy. We're not sure who started it, but skirmishes have broken out between the Iroquois and the villages, leading to most of them being pillaged and burned. The peasants and nobility alike are demanding blood."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC42:0 "As the curtains draw to a close, the audience erupts into cheers and pleas for an encore. The Flight of the Valkyries, a play centred around the retelling of the ancient Eddas, has become immensely popular in Vinland and abroad.

Over the years, they've only managed to score a handful of converts, and are mostly seen as an annoyance. However, a recent incident where a preacher chopped down a sacred tree claiming it was pagan idolatry has ignited a wave of Anti-Christian sentiment across the nation, and it falls to you on how to proceed."

Though the alliance remains stable for now, the Elysian conversion of Theyanoguin and several high-ranking Iroquois Chieftains has angered many Barbaroi who feel that their leaders are abandoning the ways of their ancestors. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of the Kykladian Islands to the south provides Elysia s merchants with exiting new trade opportunities. Establishing trade outposts in the region will help strengthen trade and communication networks with the Spartans while also allowing the Emperor to keep an eye on them. The Albanians remain a minority within our realm and are content to isolate themselves within fortified settlements, though how long this will last remains to be seen. Finally, the Viking colonies of Markland and Helluland have united under a single banner to form the nation of Vinland.

The natives on the plains have adapted the horse into their nomadic lifestyle at an astonishing rate, and even now they thunder across the plains, much like the Scythian nomads of old.

He realizes very well what position he is in, and has already redistributed wealth and power to himself from the cities he protects.

A win-win for both: trade got regulated by professionals that weren't on our payroll, and the Merchant Guild could finance further investment and expansion with the money they made. Although trade has been booming, the shares we have been receiving from the guild didn't keep pace and this has gradually resulted in a mismatch between the shares the Guild has been taking and those flowing to the state.

So it seems strange that he of all men would suggest such a thing: return to worshipping the Old Gods, the Roman and Hellenic Gods. He says he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he states that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon. If there are Gods, he continued, they must be as flawed and ill-tempered as the old Hellenic Gods.
