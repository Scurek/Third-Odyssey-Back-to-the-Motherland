 DEPRECATED_nhs2_mainlandevents.19.t:0 "A Hellenic Militia?"
 DEPRECATED_nhs2_mainlandevents.19.d:0 "As we continue our liberation of our ancestral land, we seem to have trouble with overseas administration there. Hellenes that are willing to fight for our cause have trouble enlisting in the army and taxes seem to be getting lost somewhere between the people and our treasury. One of our advisors backed by the new 'Hellenic war-council' proposed the idea of forming a Hellenic militia under the partially autonomous leadership of a local nobleman, who will ensure that all able-bodied Hellenes join the fight, while still providing a small, but steady, supply of contributions to our treasury. This solution is only temporary, but will last for the duration of the invasion."

 DEPRECATED_nhs2_mainlandevents.20.t:0 "The Fate of Konstantinia"
 DEPRECATED_nhs2_mainlandevents.20.d:0 "Our invasion of Europe is over for now, and we now must answer the question of what to do with our Greek sub state. The nobles of Konstantina are requesting that we give them complete control over the local territory, something many [GetElysiansRomans] back home are nervous about doing, but doing this would strengthen our defences in Europe. Alternatively, we could establish a less independent vassal state, which would benefit our treasury, but weaken our military presence in Europe."

 DEPRECATED_nhs2_mainlandevents.22.d:0 "With Hellas now under our control, we could set up a local government due to our inability controlling it directly, creating a sub state named after a famous Eastern Roman Emperor, Constantine. This would allow us to focus on other matters, and they would be a useful ally for any further expansion into Europe. There, as usual, are those against the bill insist that any subject we create will turn on us eventually..."
 DEPRECATED_nhs2_mainlandevents.22.a:0 "We don't really have a choice, do we?"
 DEPRECATED_nhs2_mainlandevents.22.c:0 "We should listen to the council of those wise man and take direct control of the land"
