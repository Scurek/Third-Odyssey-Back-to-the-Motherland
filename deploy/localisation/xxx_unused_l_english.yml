 ELYINFDESC01:0 "Ever since the Elysian Revolution abolished the office of Emperor and established the Elysian Republic, men from across the nation have enjoyed the privilege of electing their senators. The old aristocracy, however, is not content with peacefully surrendering their power, and is attempting to covertly subvert the republic into an oligarchy via rigged elections. Elysians everywhere are outraged by this, and the nation seems to be plunging toward a second civil war."
 ELYINFDESC02:0 "Republican diplomats from [inf_opposition_province.GetName] have approached our government, demanding that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] agree to concessions that grant more power to the peasantry, while restricting the powers of the Dynatoi."
 ELYINFDESC03:0 "A large group of Republican supporters have started a revolt in [inf_opposition_revolt_province.GetName] and have raised a considerable force to take control of [inf_opposition_revolt_province.GetAreaName]."
 ELYINFDESC04:0 "We've received reports that a preacher in [inf_opposition_preacher_province.GetName] has become despotic and tyrannical. He also has been known to support the Republican cause, and has been responsible for a recent decline in public support in [inf_opposition_preacher_province.GetAreaName]."
 ELYINFDESC05:0 "We have received reports of Republican activity in [inf_oligarchy_crackdown_province.GetName]. We could perform a harsh crackdown on the province to send a message to the Republicans, or we could more subtly investigate the reports and arrest those involved."
 ELYINFDESC06:0 "A priest in [inf_oligarchy_priest_province.GetName] has thrown his full support behind [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. He has even managed to boost public opinion of our government in [inf_oligarchy_priest_province.GetAreaName]."
 ELYINFDESC901:0 "The armies of the Dynatoi - the aristocrats, the greats, the nobility - have triumphed over the common rabble who call themselves 'Republicans' in the war for the soul of a nation! Just yesterday, the surrender of the rebel leaders was accepted, and the powerful no longer need to fear the peasantry."
 ELYINFDESC902:0 "The war has carried on for far too long. The fields lie fallow, homes lie broken, and a nation bleeds itself dry. The leaders of the Dynatoi and the Republicans have met and acknowledged that the war is at a standstill, and the best thing for the nation is peace. To that end, they signed a peace treaty promising the restoration of the First Republic"
 ELYINFDESC903:0 "Let freedom ring! Republican forces have accepted the unconditional surrender of the aristocratic government! From now on, a true republic shall be established, where all men shall be equal, free from the tyranny of despots and high nobles. The republic is dead - long live the republic!"

 ELYINFOPTA903:0 "Down with the Dynatoi! Three cheers for Elysia!"
 ELYREVDESC01:0 "Ever since the Emperor abolished the Elysian Senate, unrest has been festering throughout the Empire. Large groups across Elysia have been seen advocating for restrictions to be placed upon the Emperor's powers, and for greater rights and powers to be granted to the various peoples of the Empire. While the Presbyteroi have thrown their full support behind [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Dynatoi appear to be split between supporting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and, unthinkably, establishing a republic, in which the Dynatoi can hold considerably more power under puppet rulers. Upon hearing this, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] immediately demanded that these disloyal noblemen be apprehended and dragged before him, despite the fact that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors warn that this could very well be the spark that ignites the powder keg and plunges the Empire into civil war."
 ELYREVDESC02:0 "The Revolutionary forces have suddenly attacked the city of [rev_attacked_province.GetCapitalName], catching the local militia completely off guard! Our forces don't stand a chance; let's just hope that they can make it out of the city."
 ELYREVDESC03:0 "One of our armies was suddenly attacked by Revolutionary forces while marching toward a suspected Revolutionary stronghold. The battle appears to be favoring the Revolutionaries, and our army is taking heavy losses."
 ELYREVDESC04:0 "One of our armies has engaged Revolutionary forces that appeared to be heading toward the city of [rev_army_engaged_province.GetCapitalName]. Our superior military should have no trouble pushing back the Revolutionary forces."
 ELYREVDESC05:0 "One of our armies is successfully liberating the city of [rev_city_liberated_province.GetCapitalName] from Revolutionaries! While fighting still rages in the city, the enemy's numbers are faltering, and our commander hopes to surround [rev_city_liberated_province.GetCapitalName] and capture the remainder of the enemy forces."
 ELYREVDESC06:0 "The nation of Elysia once stood divided - brother fighting brother for control of the greatest power in the world! As the dust settles, the victors - nay, the survivors - look back and perhaps have a lingering question on their minds: 'Was it all worth it?' Regardless of the cost, however, the revolution is over, and a way forward can finally be found as muskets turn to ploughshares and brother forgives brother."

The Haudenosaunee there extend their hand in friendship, wishing to know us better."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC41:0 "When we first discovered the Iriquios, several of the explorer's followers stayed behind to set up small settlements on the fringes of the Confederacy. We're not sure who started it, but skirmishes have broken out between the Iroquois and the villages, leading to most of them being pillaged and burned. The peasants and nobility alike are demanding blood."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC42:0 "As the curtains draw to a close, the audience erupts into cheers and pleas for an encore.

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC49:0 "After nearly five centuries of separation from Europe, our language is near-alien to most Scandinavians. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has, in response, proposed a variety of reforms to bring Vinlandic more in line with traditional Norse-derived languages."

Over the years, they've only managed to score a handful of converts, and are mostly seen as an annoyance.

Though the alliance remains stable for now, the Elysian conversion of Theyanoguin and several high-ranking Iroquois Chieftains has angered many Barbaroi who feel that their leaders are abandoning the ways of their ancestors. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of the Kykladian Islands to the south provides Elysia s merchants with exiting new trade opportunities. Establishing trade outposts in the region will help strengthen trade and communication networks with the Spartans while also allowing the Emperor to keep an eye on them. The Albanians remain a minority within our realm and are content to isolate themselves within fortified settlements, though how long this will last remains to be seen.

The natives on the plains have adapted the horse into their nomadic lifestyle at an astonishing rate, and even now they thunder across the plains, much like the Scythian nomads of old. Their speed and use of ambush tactics and guerilla warfare makes them difficult to subdue by warfare, and the poor quality of the local soil makes sustaining large settlements problematic and difficult; therefore, our colonists remain in the minority, content to trade with them from small, fortified settlements and outposts."

Our capital and surroundings have stayed as true as possible to the old ways, mostly because of the formal usage at court and among the many nobles in the area, and thus the local tongue is known as High Elysian. Closest to this are the coastal provinces, in heavy contact with the capital through constant trade and transport. They are referred to as Elyshians, with a 'shi', because of the rough pronunciation of the 's' that probably became popular among sailors to be better understood at sea where the waves and wind make conversation on deck difficult. The inland has been become known as home of the Elyric, those closest to the natives and with the highest adoption of their language. The natives that have been integrated in our country itself have also undergone change under our leadership, creating a new caste of Barbaroi."

One of the higher inland nobles has now taken control of a good deal of land, through power disputes, marriage and allying lesser lords now loyal to him. He realizes very well what position he is in, and has already redistributed wealth and power to himself from the cities he protects. The city senators are too loyal or, more likely, too afraid to express any opinions in the senate other than those of their protector.

They registered merchants and taxed trade in our name, sharing half the income with the state. A win-win for both: trade got regulated by professionals that weren't on our payroll, and the Merchant Guild could finance further investment and expansion with the money they made. Although trade has been booming, the shares we have been receiving from the guild didn't keep pace and this has gradually resulted in a mismatch between the shares the Guild has been taking and those flowing to the state. The Guild has grown rather bold and denies any accusations of corruption, though they clearly have greater funds than they should be able to under the agreement.

His worship led indirectly to the decline of our ancestor empire, as explained by the first High Priest in the aftermath of the Great Storm, and the population hates the thought of letting that ever happen again. Nevertheless, some worshippers of Christ remained. And in some isolated communities, they forced their beliefs on everyone.
