 eastereggs.1.t:0 "A Christian Yuletide"
 eastereggs.1.d:0 "The Varangian pagans in the north have a long standing tradition of Yuletide, a midwinter festival that coincides with our traditional mass for Christ. After converting a conquered province to the true faith, pagans and preachers alike have continued and adopted this tradition into a traditional Christmas celebration. Local missionaries have transformed the celebration to include pagan rituals such as the burning of a ceremonial ship and placing decorated conifers in homes and public squares. The more conservative clergy in the capital finds this change disturbing, and plead with us to suppress this heathenry. Harsh action during a period of celebration is likely to elicit a fierce response however, and local missionaries have petitioned us to reconsider and accept this tradition as a Christian rite."
 EASTEREGGNAME1A:0 "If a more cheerful Christmas can convince pagans, why not?"
 EASTEREGGNAME1B:0 "This heathen abomination must be struck down!"

 eastereggs.2.t:0 "Poseidon's Yuletide"
 eastereggs.2.d:0 "The Varangian Norse in the north have a long standing tradition of Yuletide, a midwinter festival that coincides with the Posidea, a celebration for Poseidon. After converting a conquered province to the true faith, Norsemen and preachers alike have continued and adopted this tradition into a traditional Posidea celebration. Local missionaries have transformed the celebration to include pagan rituals such as the burning of a ceremonial ship and placing decorated conifers in homes and public squares. The high priests in the capital find this change disturbing, and plead with us to suppress this heathenry. Harsh action during a period of cheer is likely to elicit a fierce response however, and local missionaries have petitioned us to reconsider and include these traditions in our current celebration."
 EASTEREGGNAME2A:0 "We already have our own debaucheries during Posidea, why not include theirs?"
 EASTEREGGNAME2B:0 "This heathen abomination must be struck down!"

 eastereggs.3.t:0 "The Lady of Alexandria"
 eastereggs.3.d:0 "It is well known that members of the nobility tend toward the eccentric, but this young woman, a Konstantinia, distant relation to the old ruling family as well as daughter of a prominent Barbaroi chief hailing from Nea Alexandria, goes further than mere eccentricity. She has assembled her own picked retinue of loyal soldiers and is announcing her intention to serve the empire as a general in the reconquest of Hellas. Normally, such intent would be scoffed at openly, but this woman has already proven herself a skilled drillmaster and logistician. Perhaps it would not be so bad to give her the army she desires?"
 eastereggs.3.a:0 "All may serve Elysia."
 eastereggs.3.b:0 "She would serve us better in an advisory role."
 eastereggs.3.c:0 "Hah! A woman commanding men?!"
