Original Description:
This mod started out as a desire to colonise the new world as a faltering Byzantium and has grown out to be a much larger project than originally expected.

Discover a new experience as a young, technologically and philosophically advanced nation in a New World, with all its wonders and perils. The new Nation of Elysia has great potential to grow and become a local superpower. A ton of events and decisions give allot of context and flavor to the nation and shapes its growth and feel. There's allot of events to discover, and depending on the choices you make your experience could change completely!

Will you remain a loyal orthodox christian, or denounce the God that refused to help at times of great peril in favor of the old gods? Will you take along every possible artifact that may be of great boon, or will you take as much supplies and people as possible to avoid collapsing your economy and being overrun by natives? Consider your actions carefully, you can never know what future trouble may arise out of seemingly easy choices... 

Suggestions are of course very welcome, constructive comments have always helped in improving this mod! 

Special thanks to: 
steam user 'Dorimi' and associates of the 'Purple Phoenix Rises' mod for some of the event images and the basis of the Elysian flag. 
steam user 'Jords' for kindly helping to create an event that undiscovers the european homelands. 
Paradox forum user 'marmot01' for the helpful guides.
