[h1]About[/h1]

This mod is a sequel to the original "[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=225813038]Third Odyssey[/url]" made by "Lichtkang", and would not be possible without my co-modders adoss7, Geminus, RedInc, Legionary Guard, Arakhor, beewyka891, Lyra, and Lichtkang (yup he is back). It has grown a lot since it branched off from the original, adding tons of new content for you to enjoy!

[quote=Lichtkang]
This mod started out as a desire to colonise the new world as a faltering Byzantium and has grown out to be a much larger project than originally expected. Discover a new experience as a young, technologically and philosophically advanced nation in a New World, with all its wonders and perils.

The new Nation of Elysia has great potential to grow  and become a local superpower. A ton of events and decisions give a lot of context and flavor to the nation and shapes its growth and feel. There's allot of events to discover, and depending on the choices you make your experience could change completely! Will you remain a loyal orthodox christian, or denounce the God that refused to help at times of great peril in favor of the old gods? Will you take along every possible artifact that may be of great boon, or will you take as much supplies and people as possible to avoid collapsing your economy and being overrun by natives? Consider your actions carefully, you can never know what future trouble may arise out of seemingly easy choices...
