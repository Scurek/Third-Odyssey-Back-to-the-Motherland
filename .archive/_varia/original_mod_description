[i]Mod Version 0.91 - compatible EUIV 1.7[/i]
(you can always roll back EUIV to 1.7 in settings to play the mod if you really want to)

It is the most advanced spinoff of this mod, and I'll be helping the development together with their original team. As far as I'm concerned, it's the official succesor to this mod.

[b]Description:[/b]
This mod started out as a desire to colonise the new world as a faltering Byzantium and has grown out to be a much larger project than originally expected.

Discover a new experience as a young, technologically and philosophically advanced nation in a New World, with all its wonders and perils. The new Nation of Elysia has great potential to grow and become a local superpower. A ton of events and decisions give allot of context and flavor to the nation and shapes its growth and feel. There's allot of events to discover, and depending on the choices you make your experience could change completely! 

Will you remain a loyal orthodox christian, or denounce the God that refused to help at times of great peril in favor of the old gods? Will you take along every possible artifact that may be of great boon, or will you take as much supplies and people as possible to avoid collapsing your economy and being overrun by natives? Consider your actions carefully, you can never know what future trouble may arise out of seemingly easy choices...

[b]Planned content:[/b]
[list][*]More flavor and interaction regarding the other Elysian nations that arise
[*]A new bookmark where Elysia is already formed
[*]A strong late game in flavor events and, more importantly, missions to get back in Europe
[*]Your suggestions?[/list]

Suggestions are of course very welcome, constructive comments have always helped in improving this mod!

[b]Special thanks to:[/b]
[list][*]steam user 'Dorimi' and associates of the 'Purple Phoenix Rises' mod for some of the event images and the basis of the Elysian flag.
[*]steam user 'Jords' for kindly helping to create an event that undiscovers the european homelands.
[*]Paradox forum user 'marmot01' for the helpful guides.[/list]

[b]KNOWN ISSUES:[/b]
[list][*]Province names don't show on map: this is a vanilla problem with auto-discovering neighboring provinces. It'll fix itself when you refresh your map.
[*]It is possible to westernise, even though the government form should disable it.
[*]Buggy 'repairing of decayed provinces' decisions. Display of a 'removed' province modifier icon sometimes occurs. Mousing over it will cause the game to crash due to a literal Paradox within the game... How Ironic.
[*]NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER MODS that change files from the base game, especially those that change religions and tech groups. User interface mods are also unlikely to work.[/list]
