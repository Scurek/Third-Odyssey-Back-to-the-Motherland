 BOOKMARK_RISE_OF_ELYSIA_DESC:0 "The Third Odyssey is now well underway, with the Elysians enduring many hardships in their quest to establish themselves in the vast continent of Elysium. However, their troubles are not over yet. With refugees from the nation of Shqiperi settling inside their lands, the splinter nation of Spartakon establishing themselves in the southern jungles, and the newly discovered and mysterious Vikings menacing from the north, could this be the end for the Elysians, or will they rise and become the greatest empire the world has ever known?"

 THIRD_ODYSSEY_MP_DESC:0 "While the journey across the ocean is over, the Third Odyssey has just begun. Now stranded in an unknown land, the Byzantine exiles had made sacrifices of their territory and integrity and lost many men and women to the perils of the Atlantic. Tough decisions have been made, ones which will surely haunt them in the future. But now, a whole world of opportunity awaits. The Promised Land of Elysium stands before them - will the people of Nea Konstantinoupolis be strong, witty, and resourceful enough to take it?"

 nhs_countryevents.101.d:0 "Our connection to the inland population has always been much smaller than with those along the coasts and near our capital. The system of governance was adapted for this problem by instituting traditional nobles in a feudal order responsible for their part of the realm. By employing the traditional noble class like this we also inherited the problems we faced in medieval times, since we continued to give our nobles their privileges. One of the higher inland nobles has now taken control of a good deal of land, through power disputes, marriage and allying lesser lords now loyal to him. He realizes very well what position he is in, and has already redistributed wealth and power to himself from the cities he protects. The city senators are too loyal or, more likely, too afraid to express any opinions in the senate other than those of their protector. If we do not deal with this threat in some way the country may fracture entirely as other protector lords claim more power of their own!"

Once the system was up and running there was no real need for the state to spend money regulating trade, instead we gave this power to a merchant's guild. They registered merchants and taxed trade in our name, sharing half the income with the state. A win-win for both: trade got regulated by professionals that weren't on our payroll, and the Merchant Guild could finance further investment and expansion with the money they made. Although trade has been booming, the shares we have been receiving from the guild didn't keep pace and this has gradually resulted in a mismatch between the shares the Guild has been taking and those flowing to the state. The Guild has grown rather bold and denies any accusations of corruption, though they clearly have greater funds than they should be able to under the agreement.

So it seems strange that he of all men would suggest such a thing: return to worshipping the Old Gods, the Roman and Hellenic Gods. He says he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he states that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon. If there are Gods, he continued, they must be as flawed and ill-tempered as the old Hellenic Gods.

This Second Elysian Republic also threatens other nation states with its strong beliefs in liberty, freedom, and the abolition of nobility."
 ELYINFDESC01:0 "Ever since the Elysian Revolution abolished the office of Emperor and established the Elysian Republic, men from across the nation have enjoyed the privilege of electing their senators. The old aristocracy, however, is not content with peacefully surrendering their power, and is attempting to covertly subvert the republic into an oligarchy via rigged elections.

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC14:0 "Your steward has approached you with a grand project: a massive palace constructed from the bones of whales, the Hvulvkíði Kðsstala. While the cost may be immense, completing the building would almost certainly raise Vinland to the status of the European monarchies. The engineers are already calling it the 'Versailles of the New World'."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC15:0 "As any proper monarch should, you have correspondences all over the world. One of them, an Indian prince, has sent you a rather strange gift: a small golden statue of the Buddha. What makes it strange is the Norse runes carved on its back, almost as old as the statue. The prince writes that it has been an heirloom in his family ever since a strange, bearded warrior from a far away land wrecked himself on the shores of India. He conquered the local land and lorded over it, before finally returning home. The statue was one of the things he left behind."

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC19:0 "Change is coming to our corner of the world. The heavy axes and halberds of our forefathers are slowly being replaced by the arquebus and cannon. Rather than lament the loss of the old ways of combat, our generals have taken to gunpowder readily."

However, explorers have come upon the Hvalsey Church, a small stone chapel inhabited by a single monk, likely the only Norseman left on the entire island. They're not sure what to do with him."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC20:0 "Since its founding, Vinland's expansion has been haphazard, usually in the wake of an impromptu war against a native tribe or some adventurer taking it upon himself to found a new village. However, new legislation recently passed in the Althing would change that. It would strictly forbid individuals from claiming new land for Vinland without an official government grant; this would discourage many potential settlers, but also make the entire colonial process much more efficient."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC21:0 "While browsing your private library, you come upon an ancient tome you have never seen before. Binding worn and torn, you open it up to face a cloud of dust. When it settles, you read the mysterious book's secrets.\n\n'Not so long ago, Vinland still clung to the old ways, and it made our nation strong. By Thor, by Odin, I pray we one day turn away from the cursed White Christ.'\n\nThe book makes many blasphemous statements, but yet, you find many of its points profoundly hard to dispute..."

An elaborate coronation ceremony has already been planned, where [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be bestowed the Jewel of the North, a specially crafted crown adorned with turquoise and diamonds. All the Althing needs is your approval, and of course, the funds..."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC26:0 "A hundred years ago, a group of Vinlandic nobles where exiled due to various homicides, the most grave of crimes in a small, struggling community, and so they and their families established themselves to the north and created a small country focused on the wood industry, Markland.\nOne day we shall return to Vinland and claim their throne from the Althing."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC28:0 "It's finally happened. The mighty Iroquois Confederacy and Vinland are now at war; the two most powerful armies in the region will soon be facing each other in battle.

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC30:0 "For years Vinland has been plagued by instability and abuse from [Root.Monarch.GetName], and the Althing has finally had enough.

Likewise, men and women alike rally behind our king, determined to stand fast in preservation of the old ways."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC34:0 "Beyond a life in the Janissaries, a Greek man's military prospects are rather limited, and those that escape servitude to the Sultan become mercenaries abroad. Recently, a rather large Greek mercenary band has found their way to Vinland, and their captain has sent you a very intriguing offer. It calls for the formation of the Byzantine Guard, a Greek-only band of bodyguards to the Emperors and Empresses of Vinland, extremely disciplined and absolutely loyal."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC35:0 "It's no secret that Greenland's name is rather...misleading. While the lie has attracted many gullible colonists in the past, nowadays it's mostly seen as a cruel joke. Petitions have made their way to you asking to finally drop the deception, but none can agree on what the new name should actually be."

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC37:0 "We have broken the Onondaga, and with that, the nominal capital of the Confederacy. With no central leadership, the nations of the Iroquois will come uncoordinated and that much easier to defeat!"
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC38:0 "Vinland has gained control over the territories of the Cayuga and Oneida, removing them from the war. The loss of these two nations, the 'Younger Brothers' of the ancient Iroquois political system, will both destabilise the Confederacy and deliver a huge blow to their morale."

 flavor_vov.EVTDESC4:0 "Regular communion with the Catholic Church has been established for some time. However, the years of separation between the Pope and the Hibernian Church has led to our peoples adopting practices that are borderline heretical to the greater Christian world. The Pope is offering to ignore this heathenry in exchange for a particularly large tithe..."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC40:0 "Though we've long heard rumours of a powerful nation to the southwest, one of our explorers has finally discovered it. Graciously greeted by the natives, he learned that this faraway land is known as the Iroquois Confederacy, a union of nations bound together by an unwritten constitution known as the Great Law of Peace. The Haudenosaunee there extend their hand in friendship, wishing to know us better."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC41:0 "When we first discovered the Iriquios, several of the explorer's followers stayed behind to set up small settlements on the fringes of the Confederacy. We're not sure who started it, but skirmishes have broken out between the Iroquois and the villages, leading to most of them being pillaged and burned. The peasants and nobility alike are demanding blood."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC42:0 "As the curtains draw to a close, the audience erupts into cheers and pleas for an encore. The Flight of the Valkyries, a play centred around the retelling of the ancient Eddas, has become immensely popular in Vinland and abroad. While people love the costumes and dialogue, the biggest attraction is the play's musical score, which people swear invoke feelings of glory and bravery."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC44:0 "It has come to our attention that the magnificent Temple at Uppsala was destroyed some time ago by Swedish Christians. Faithful followers of the All-father that we are, many around the country are clamouring for a new Temple to be built in Vinland, greater and more magnificent than ever."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC45:0 "New farming techniques have made their way to Vinland, greatly boosting crop yields. As a result, we have experienced a significant population boom, and many are seeking a less crowded life elsewhere in North America."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC46:0 "We have held dominion over the island that the local skrælings call Ayiti, or as we pronounce it, Haiti, for decades. Local Norsemen on the island have intermarried with Taino tribes and imported slaves for so long that the island's population has a culture distinct from the rest of Vinland; a rich blend of Norse, Taino, and African."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC48:0 "We've done it! The great and fertile lands around the five vast lakes now belong to Vinland, and we are quickly undergoing the process of incorporating the former Confederacy into our nation."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC49:0 "After nearly five centuries of separation from Europe, our language is near-alien to most Scandinavians. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has, in response, proposed a variety of reforms to bring Vinlandic more in line with traditional Norse-derived languages."

Over the years, they've only managed to score a handful of converts, and are mostly seen as an annoyance. However, a recent incident where a preacher chopped down a sacred tree claiming it was pagan idolatry has ignited a wave of Anti-Christian sentiment across the nation, and it falls to you on how to proceed."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC53:0 "Though it has been long considered a part of Vinland, another nation has claimed Greenland as their own. However, it is apparently far less profitable than they anticipated, and are looking to sell it to use for a modest sum."
 flavor_vov.EVTDESC54:0 "The great island of the coast now belongs to Vinland. While there were Lenape skraelings living there, they were convinced to leave 'Manhattan' after we bought the island from them for just a few silver coins."

Suddenly your guards appear behind you, relieved that you are unharmed. You look to where the man was and see only dirt."

Though the alliance remains stable for now, the Elysian conversion of Theyanoguin and several high-ranking Iroquois Chieftains has angered many Barbaroi who feel that their leaders are abandoning the ways of their ancestors. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of the Kykladian Islands to the south provides Elysia s merchants with exiting new trade opportunities. Establishing trade outposts in the region will help strengthen trade and communication networks with the Spartans while also allowing the Emperor to keep an eye on them. The Albanians remain a minority within our realm and are content to isolate themselves within fortified settlements, though how long this will last remains to be seen. Finally, the Viking colonies of Markland and Helluland have united under a single banner to form the nation of Vinland.

One of our advisors suggested that we use this opportunity to trick the nations of Europe, making them believe that we were caught up in a series of increasingly treacherous storms filled with sea monsters and that our last act was to inform them.

So it seems strange that he of all men would suggest such a thing: return to worshipping the Old Gods, the Roman and Hellenic Gods. He said he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he stated that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon.

 nhs2_cultureevents.1.d:0 "As our people move into the western half of this great continent we call Elysium, the landscape has slowly changed from being dotted with small hills and woodland and has given way to great plains and grasslands. Large numbers of wild horses that either escaped or were released over the years have flourished in such an environment, and seem to have colonised this continent better than we have! The natives on the plains have adapted the horse into their nomadic lifestyle at an astonishing rate, and even now they thunder across the plains, much like the Scythian nomads of old. Their speed and use of ambush tactics and guerilla warfare makes them difficult to subdue by warfare, and the poor quality of the local soil makes sustaining large settlements problematic and difficult; therefore, our colonists remain in the minority, content to trade with them from small, fortified settlements and outposts."
 nhs2_cultureevents.1.t:0 "The Skythian Plains"
 nhs2_cultureevents.101.a:0 "We have become a fair lot!"
 nhs2_cultureevents.101.d:0 "Just like our culture changed away from our ancestral Hellenic, our people have spread far and wide and slight differences in behaviour and language have become noticeable. Our capital and surroundings have stayed as true as possible to the old ways, mostly because of the formal usage at court and among the many nobles in the area, and thus the local tongue is known as High Elysian. Closest to this are the coastal provinces, in heavy contact with the capital through constant trade and transport. They are referred to as Elyshians, with a 'shi', because of the rough pronunciation of the 's' that probably became popular among sailors to be better understood at sea where the waves and wind make conversation on deck difficult. The inland has been become known as home of the Elyric, those closest to the natives and with the highest adoption of their language. The natives that have been integrated in our country itself have also undergone change under our leadership, creating a new caste of Barbaroi."

Just as the most Roman of the Barbaroi took to calling themselves Elysians, rather than Romans, so too did many of the lowest classes in our realm.

He says he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he states that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon. If there are Gods, he continued, they must be as flawed and ill-tempered as the old Hellenic Gods.
