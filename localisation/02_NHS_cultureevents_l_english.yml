 nhs2_cultureevents.1.t:0 "The Skythian Plains"
 nhs2_cultureevents.1.d:0 "As our people move into the western half of this great continent we call Elysium, the landscape has slowly changed from being dotted with small hills and woodland and has given way to great plains and grasslands. Large numbers of wild horses that either escaped or were released over the years have flourished in such an environment, and seem to have colonised this continent better than we have! The natives on the plains have adapted the horse into their nomadic lifestyle at an astonishing rate, and even now they thunder across the plains, much like the Scythian nomads of old. Their speed and use of ambush tactics and guerilla warfare makes them difficult to subdue by warfare, and the poor quality of the local soil makes sustaining large settlements problematic and difficult; therefore, our colonists remain in the minority, content to trade with them from small, fortified settlements and outposts."
 nhs2_cultureevents.1.a:0 "Maybe one day we can teach these natives our ways."

 nhs2_cultureevents.4.t:0 "The Skythiai, subdued at last?"
 nhs2_cultureevents.4.d:0 "After many years, life on the plains is still much the same as it has always been: men riding horses, competing with rival tribes, hunting buffalo, and trading. However, there is one big difference, those men riding the horses? they are Elysians, or at least their forefathers were. Over time, the colonists slowly left their settlements and adopted the ways of the nomads. Now known as the Skythiai, they still (basically) follow the same religion as we do, and still (kind of) pledge allegiance to the Emperor, they are just a bit rough around the edges." 
 nhs2_cultureevents.4.a:0 "It's a Wild West out there!"

 nhs2_cultureevents.8.t:0 "The Borealian Lakes"
 nhs2_cultureevents.8.d:0 "The Elysians of the North, or 'Borealians' as we call them, are a tough people of mixed Elysian-Vinlandic and Barbaroi descent who inhabit the northern regions of Elysium, as well as the large inland lakes from which they get their name. As a people of the frontier, the Borealians provide much of the Empire's fur and timber trade and are often hired as scouts and trackers when war breaks out in the region. Borealians speak with what is barely considered an Elysian dialect and have adopted several native and Viking traditions that are treated with scorn by their more 'respectable' brethren to the south. Despite this, they remain loyal members of the Elysian Empire and are lauded for their ability to survive the harsh northern winter year-round."
 nhs2_cultureevents.8.a:0 "Let us hope they continue to do so."

 nhs2_cultureevents.10.t:0 "The Hesperidian Fields"
 nhs2_cultureevents.10.da:0 "Hesperidians are the descendants of those who colonised the deserts of the Elysian interior. While some travelled west and settled the inhospitable lands in and around across the Atlas Mountains, others established now already prospering cities on much more fertile lands along the coast. The great distance from the capital has led to the Hesperidians adopting a much more laid back stance in relation to tradition and religion. As a result, many of our more rebellious and free thinking subjects have flocked there in great numbers."
 nhs2_cultureevents.10.db:0 "Hesperidians are the descendants of those colonists who made the long journey toward the fertile, but remote lands on the western coast of Elysium. The great distance from the capital and the presence of the Atlas Mountains have led to the Hesperidians adopting a much more laid back stance in relation to tradition and religion. As a result, many of our more rebellious and free thinking subjects have flocked there in the thousands."
 nhs2_cultureevents.10.dc:0 "Hesperidians are the descendants of those colonists who travelled west across the Atlas Mountains, which stretch from north to south at the far end of the Skythian Plains. The great distance from the capital has led to the Hesperidians adopting a much more laid back stance in relation to tradition and religion. As a result, many of our more rebellious and free thinking subjects have flocked there in the thousands."

 nhs2_cultureevents.21.t:0 "Hesperidians Expand East"
 nhs2_cultureevents.21.d:0 "With the establishment of several large ports and towns in the far western region, many Hesperidians and like minded individuals began settling in our newly established and similarly remote trade outposts between Scythian plains and the lowlands of Hesperidia."
 nhs2_cultureevents.21.a:0 "Let the dissidents run to the hills."
 
 nhs2_cultureevents.22.t:0 "Hesperidians Push West"
 nhs2_cultureevents.22.d:0 "Having settled the lands in and around the Atlas Mountains, the Hesperidians have begun moving into the more fertile plains on the west coast to establish new trading ports. With a strong trade network to the rest of the Empire already established, new goods are now flowing back to the more developed eastern coast and more importantly the capital."

 nhs2_cultureevents.15.da:0 "The islands to the south of our great nation, known as Kykladia to our people, have undergone quite a shift in recent decades. Being relatively isolated from the rest of the Empire and their Elyshi cousins has allowed our settlers in the region to adopt some of the strange customs of from the native Taino, such as a form of ancestor and nature worship mixed with our own beliefs. This has lead to the creation of many smaller communities divided along ancestral lines, with a focus on maritime trade and piracy."

Since then, the Thouleans largely integrated with peoples who have lived there for millennia, adopting many of their cultures and traditions. Greatly distrusting of foreign powers and opposed to any attempts at centralisation, the Thouleans simply wish to be left alone."

 nhs_lakonian_spartans_title:0 "The Lakonian Spartans"
 nhs_lakonian_spartans_desc:0 "With our conquering of lands that once belonged to the Spartans, we must somehow integrate our 'cousins' back into the empire. The presence of the heretical Aztlan cult aside, the people living in these lands are extremely independent, and do not appreciate our presence here. The best we can do is give them some autonomy and hope they don't rebel too often."
