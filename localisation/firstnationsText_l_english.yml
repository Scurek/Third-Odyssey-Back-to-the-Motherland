 firstnations.1.t:0 "Welcome to the Third Odyssey"
 firstnations.1.d:0 "Thank you for trying out the Third Odyssey!\n\n You will now be playing as the once lost Mississippian nation known to us only as \"Cahokia\". Little is known of this civilization that left us with the ruins of their grandiose mound cities, that, in their prime, challenged the greatest of the European metropoles in size and population.\nIn this timeline however their cities still stand with streets filled with proud, strong folk that was able to overcome a series of terrible, near ruinous catastrophes. Now a shadow of their former gigantic selves, amidst wilderness, nomads and barbarian foreigners, they must rise to greatness yet again and bring the great city of Cahokia to new heights, as the hearth of the great Mississippi River!"
 firstnations.1.a:0 "Let's get started!"
 firstnations.2.t:0 "A Native Metropolis"
 firstnations.2.d:0 "As we explore the continent, we have made marvellous discoveries, from new fauna and flora to great and intricate rivers and several other surprises, but we certainly can't say that we ever expected to find something like what the natives call \"Cahokia\"!\nA grand city, built on top of giant earth mounds and standing between the intersection of three great rivers, Cahokia stands both as an oddity and as a shining example of the potential of this new land and its people."
 firstnations.2.a:0 "Truly a sight to behold."
