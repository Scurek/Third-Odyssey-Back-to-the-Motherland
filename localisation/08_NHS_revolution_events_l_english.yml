 ELYREVNAME01:0 "The Elysian Revolution"
 ELYREVDESC01:0 "Ever since the Emperor abolished the Elysian Senate, unrest has been festering throughout the Empire. Large groups across Elysia have been seen advocating for restrictions to be placed upon the Emperor's powers, and for greater rights and powers to be granted to the various peoples of the Empire. While the Presbyteroi have thrown their full support behind [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Dynatoi appear to be split between supporting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and, unthinkably, establishing a republic, in which the Dynatoi can hold considerably more power under puppet rulers. Upon hearing this, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] immediately demanded that these disloyal noblemen be apprehended and dragged before him, despite the fact that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors warn that this could very well be the spark that ignites the powder keg and plunges the Empire into civil war."
