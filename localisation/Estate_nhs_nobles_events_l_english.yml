 nhs_nobles_estate_events.1.d:0 "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army however common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.1.a:0 "Guarantee their right to command our armies."

 nhs_nobles_estate_events.2.t:0 "Advancement of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.2.d:0 "The state is not the sole source of influence in our country. Over the last few decades a charismatic champion of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ has successfully managed to increase the power of the leading families of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ over most of the institutions of our country.\nContacts and privileges can be powerful things, especially combined with ambition."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.2.a:0 "Ok."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.3.t:0 "$ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ Encroachment"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.3.d:0 "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.3.a:0 "Let it slide."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.3.b:0 "Demand that the land be returned."

 nhs_nobles_estate_events.4.d:0 "A representative of the people living in an area dominated by one of the most prominent families of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ has approached the throne today imploring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take action against what he claims are systematic abuses of power against the people there. As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long term growth of the province. The $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.4.a:0 "Turn a blind eye."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.4.b:0 "Chastise the landowner."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.5.t:0 "Declining Power of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.5.d:0 "As both influential land owners and the traditional warrior class in our state the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ have not fared well lately. Through a combination of excessive infighting and poorly coordinated power plays the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ have lost influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and many have retired to their properties in the countryside."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.5.a:0 "Ok."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.6.t:0 "$ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ demand Stricter Sumptuary Laws"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.6.d:0 "Expensive clothes, great banquets, and impressive palaces are some of the most visible symbols of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ but the degree to which one family has money to spend on such things can vary greatly. In some cases the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They now suggest a number of heavy fines for anyone trying to rise visibly above their betters."

 nhs_nobles_estate_events.7.t:0 "The Levee"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.7.d:0 "In time many of the everyday occurrences in the life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his predecessors has become the subject of ceremony. Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as he dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ would likely resent it."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.7.a:0 "Let's keep it at a modest level."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.7.b:0 "An elaborate and lengthy ceremony for the most influential."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.7.c:0 "We have no need of such things."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.8.t:0 "Deteriorating Relations with the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.8.d:0 "Relations between the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could hardly be worse. The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.8.a:0 "Leave them be."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.8.b:0 "Force them to accept state authority."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.9.t:0 "Insubordinate $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.9.d:0 "None of our subjects are more associated with war than the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$. Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country however has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination have become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.9.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.9.b:0 "It is high time we replaced them with men of true ability."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.9.c:0 "It is high time we replaced them with men we can trust."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.9.dd:0 "Let us consult the Brahmin, some of these learned men are clearly fit to lead."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.10.t:0 "Growth of the Administration"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.10.d:0 "As the state and its bureaucracy grow there is an ever growing need of people to oversee and administrate various lands and functions. The $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ have traditionally been more associated with military services to the state but have increasingly made it clear that they still expect to be first in line when government offices are being handed out. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ on the other hand claim that the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ considers such appointments as mere rewards and will use them only to enrich themselves. Instead the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ argue we should appoint men out of individual merit.\nThe unexpected death of a trusted secretary has left a vacant position to be filled at the centre of this conflict, with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ supporting one candidate and the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ expecting us to pick another. While both candidates are talented men this has to be a political decision."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.10.a:0 "With a great pedigree come great abilities."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.10.b:0 "Self-made men are what we need to run this country."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.10.c:0 "Let us turn to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ instead."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.10.dd:0 "Let us turn to the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ instead."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.11.t:0 "Tradition of Service"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.11.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ have a long tradition of service to the state both as military leaders or more recently as dependable administrators. In a state where the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ are as strongly entrenched and loyal as ours this means that from time to time nobles of great talent and loyalty will emerge to lead the country to greatness."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.11.a:0 "Great!"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.12.t:0 "Rise of the [Root.GetName] $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.12.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ are refusing to accept the confiscation of their property in [Root.GetName] and have risen in revolt against us!"

 nhs_nobles_estate_events.13.t:0 "Wavering Loyalty of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.13.d:0 "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ grow older our warm relations has grown colder. We need to make create arrangements with the current breed of nobles in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.13.a:0 "Ok."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.14.t:0 "The $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ Seize Power"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.14.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has allowed the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ of $COUNTRY$ to grow too powerful and now they have made their move. Exercising the wide range of privileges and rights granted to them, they have effectively seized the reins of government and turned the $MONARCHTITLE$ into little more than their puppet."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.14.a:0 "We should have seen this coming..."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.14.a.tt:0 "[Root.GetName] will now be controlled by the §YNobility§! until the §Y'Curtail the Nobility'§! decision is taken."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.15.t:0 "The $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ Curtailed"
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.15.d:0 "We have managed to limit the influence of the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ to tolerable levels. $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ privileges have been revoked and their properties reduced. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ themselves have grudgingly agreed that the $MONARCHTITLE$ is the undisputable leader of this country and the stamp formerly used by the $ESTATE_NHS_NOBLES$ in place of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] signature has been destroyed."
 nhs_nobles_estate_events.15.a:0 "The $MONARCHTITLE$ is back in control."
 
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.1.t:0 "Officer Dispute"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.1.d:0 "The latest dispute between members of the Pipiltin and Apogonoi caste surrounds which faction should have the right to appoint high ranking officers in the military. The Apogonoi argue that their status as descendants of the first Spartan warriors gives them the sole right to lead our armies into battle, and that this is how it has always been. The Pipiltin on the other hand state that by excluding their members from high ranking military positions, we are preventing many accomplished native warriors from doing their part for the state."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.1.a:0 "The Apogonoi are right, we must keep things the way our ancestors did them."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.1.b:0 "The Pipiltin are right, open up military leadership positions to the native nobility."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.2.t:0 "Apogonoi encroaching ancestral land"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.2.d:0 "As the Apogonoi expand their influence further and further away from the cities, they encroach upon traditionally Pipiltin lands and villages, leading to minor skirmishes between forces loyal to each side. Though such disputes are usually resolved on their own, an Apogonoi noble has recently approached you and demands that we concede him the Pipiltin lands or he and his allies will rise up in rebellion."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.2.a:0 "Fine, give him what he wants and get him out of my sight!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.2.b:0 "How dare he blackmail me? Arrest him!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.3.t:0 "Apogonoi familiy loses power to the Pipiltin"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.3.d:0 "Though the Pipiltin Nobility are mostly loyal to us and our ways, their fierce rivalry with members of the Apogonoi caste often drives them to raid the lands of especially ruthless nobles. This usually results in a stalemate, with the Apogonoi nobles too powerful to conquer alone and the Pipiltin too dis-unified to have any lasting impact. However, an Apogonoi noble has recently overstepped his bounds in regards to the treatment of his native subjects, causing a number of Pipiltin nobles to raid and seize the entire estate. How should we handle this matter?"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.3.a:0 "Let the Pipiltin keep their new lands but ensure the safe release of the Apogonoi noble."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.3.b:0 "Give the Apogonoi noble back his lands and have the Pipiltin noble punished!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.4.t:0 "Encroachment of State Lands"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.4.d:0 "An especially fertile crop growing region currently owned by the state has recently come under the gaze of both the Apogonoi and Pipiltin Nobles. Though this land is of great use to the state, it could be given to either side to increase their loyalty to the King."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.4.a:0 "Give the land to the Pipiltin nobles."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.4.b:0 "Give the land to the Apogonoi nobles."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.4.c:0 "The lands belongs to us!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.41.t:0 "Appointing a new minister"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.41.d:0 "As members of the royal council are killed or resign from their posts, new members must be elected from those among high ranking positions. The recent opening up of a powerful position has the Apogonoi and Pipiltin both putting forward their preferred candidates. In addition, members of the Pochteca and Priesthood caste could be selected. Which one shall we choose?"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.41.a:0 "Select the Pipiltin applicant"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.41.b:0 "Appoint the Apogonoi noble"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.41.c:0 "Accept the Pochteca candidate"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.41.e:0 "We need a holy man in this position!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.5.t:0 "Decline of Apogonoi Power"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.5.d:0 "While usually the Apogonoi nobles enjoy a great deal of control over the royal family in regards to preferential treatment, a combination of over taxation of their subjects and a series of native raids and peasant uprisings within their territory has caused their power of wane as of late."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.5.a:0 "Let's take advantage of their weakness"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.6.t:0 "Decline of Pipiltin Power"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.6.d:0 "When united, the Pipiltin nobility can become a powerful political force within our state, able to coordinate and unify native tribes across the empire. Luckily for us, a recent conflict over succession between the more powerful Pipiltin nobles has severely weakened and divided them once again, and it will be a while before they are willing to work together again."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.6.a:0 "That will give us some time"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.7.t:0 "Apogonoi Tyrant"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.7.d:0 "A representative of the people living in an area dominated by one of the most prominent families of the Apogonoi has approached the throne today imploring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take action against what he claims are systematic abuses of power against the people there. As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long term growth of the province.

 spartan_nobility_estates_events.7.a:0 "Let him do as he pleases, this time..."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.7.b:0 "We must punish him for over stepping his bounds."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.8.t:0 "Pipiltin Extremist"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.8.d:0 "A charismatic anti-Spartan member of the Pipiltin nobility has recently found a number of supporters among other nobles in one of our provinces. While he and his supporters are too weak to call for outright independence, they will disrupt our efforts in the local area."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.8.a:0 "Let them do as they wish, they are not even worth the effort."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.8.b:0 "Bring the local nobles into line."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.9.t:0 "Apogonoi family gains influence"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.9.d:0 "An Apogonoi noble family has recently gained influence in the royal court for contributing a great amount of manpower and money to the state in the funding of a recent military campaign."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.9.a:0 "Such actions should be rewarded, give one of their sons a high-ranking military position!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.10.t:0 "Pipiltin noble gains influence"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.10.d:0 "Though often seen as a nuisance by many of our non-native subjects, even they were impressed by the ferocity that a Pipiltin noble and his warrior band showed as they drove back a foreign tribe that was attacking a border city, saving many lives in the process."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.10.a:0 "Reward this noble and his men!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.11.t:0 "Pipiltin Levee"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.11.d:0 "A powerful and experienced Pipiltin noble who spent his life loyally serving the state has recently been forced to retire from service due to injury. Keen to continue serving, he has been placed in an advisory position, while his men are integrated into a number of veteran army units."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.11.a:0 "Most commendable!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.12.t:0 "Apogonoi Tradition"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.12.d:0 "Since the days of their Spartan ancestors, it has been tradition of powerful Apogonoi noble families to provide their oldest son with a military education with the expectation that they will one day command armies in battle. An especially skilled Apogonoi noble has risen through the ranks and is ready to lead at your command."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.12.a:0 "Lead with honour!"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.13.t:0 "Disloyal Apogonoi"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.13.d:0 "An Apogonoi noble has recently shown that he cannot be trusted to serve in his military position, with the revelation that he has been purposely withholding his troops from battle despite repeated warnings. What should we do with him?"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.13.a:0 "This isn't ideal, but let him remain in service."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.13.b:0 "It is time to replace him with someone of real ability."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.13.c:0 "Sometimes the local nobility are more trustworthy than the power hungry Apogonoi."

 spartan_nobility_estates_events.14.t:0 "Disloyal Pipiltin"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.14.d:0 "An important and influential Pipiltin noble who spoke for a local clan has been caught communicating with a foreign and hostile enemy tribe, giving them information which allowed them to avoid our patrols. What should we do with him?"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.14.a:0 "Reprimand the noble, but let him keep his position."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.14.b:0 "It is time to replace him with a more loyal subject"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.14.c:0 "Let us put our trust in the true Spartan elite, the Apogonoi!"

 spartan_nobility_estates_events.15.d:0 "Both the Apogonoi and Pipiltin nobility have recently gained a large amount of influence within the state, and are using this power to further their rivalry. We cannot allow this situation to continue, but how should we go about remedying it?"
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.15.a:0 "Bring the Apogonoi down a peg."
 spartan_nobility_estates_events.15.b:0 "Reduce the power of the Pipiltin."
