 nhs_new_flightevents.1.d:0 "The emperor has been approached by his close confidante, Georgios Sphrantzes, who argues that we should take with us that this made us respected in ages past: our learning. The most important books and scrolls, including the manuscripts detailing the construction process for truly ocean-worthy vessels, should be collected into a library and given a place in the fleet. In addition, a skilled German engineer named Johannes Grandt was able to recreate Greek Fire on a limited scale based on scrolls stored in a hidden cache in the imperial library, and is requesting that space on the fleet be allotted to storing the substance and the ingredients used to make it. Such endeavors would be expensive and cost precious space, but they might be worth it."

 nhs_new_flightevents.2.t:0 "The Silk of the Empire"
 nhs_new_flightevents.2.d:0 "The emperor Ioannes' cousin, Theophilos Palaiologos - mathematician, grammarist, and second in line for the throne behind the emperor's brother, Konstantinos - has requested that the vast silk reserve of the Roman Empire, and the resources required to produce it, be collected into our westbound fleet. Silk, he says, has long been the garment of royalty and empire, and would make a fine luxury trade good as well. Such would cost us precious space though, and we may need all the people and supplies we can get. At the very least, he requests that if we do not take the silk along, that we instead destroy it to prevent the Ottoman Sultanate from discovering its production methods."
 nhs_new_flightevents.2.a:0 "Add it to the list."
 
 nhs_new_flightevents.3.t:0 "The Venetian Captains"
 nhs_new_flightevents.3.d:0 "A pair of Venetian captains who sold their vessels for usage on the journey have recently approached the emperor and his advisors, stating that to cross the Atlantic Ocean, the Romans would need more than just a fleet of galleasses and small caravels. One of the merchant-captains, Gabriele Trevisano, has requested a portion of our rapidly-dwindling treasury be set aside to purchase the latest in Italian and Portuguese ship designs to replace the less-seaworthy ships in the Roman navy, as well as to hire expert Mediterranean navigators and sailors, and to retrofit our older designs with modern weapons."
 nhs_new_flightevents.3.a:0 "We'll have to consider their plan, at least."
 
 nhs_new_flightevents.4.t:0 "The Venetian Captains"
 nhs_new_flightevents.4.d:0 "A pair of Venetian captains who sold their vessels for the journey have recently approached the emperor and his advisors, stating that to cross the great western ocean, the Romans would need more than just a fleet of galleasses and small caravels. One of the merchant-captains, Delfino Delfin, has offered to use his own connections as a member of one of the original founding families of the Republic, along with part of the dwindling Roman treasury, to acquire a portion of the famed Arsenal of Venice for Roman use. Using our nearly exhausted treasury on such a prize would drastically reduce our ability to purchase food and other supplies, but would give us a marked advantage in any battles to come."

 nhs_new_flightevents.7.d:0 "One final question remains in regards to our holdings. While we're resigned to [Root.Capital.GetName] falling to the Turks, we can still decide the fate of our southern holdings. Our vassals in the Duchy of Athens would make good use of the strong defensive positions in the southern highlands; but, as we just conquered the Athenians earlier this year, they would certainly find such a move odd. A delegation from the Republic of Genoa, headed by a certain Archbishop Leonard of Chios, has expressed a desire to increase their economic penetration of the Aegean and Black Seas - something that could easily be accomplished by selling the Despotate of the Morea to Genoa. Finally, we could grant direct independence to the Morean Despotate under the leadership of the emperor's brother, Theodoros."

 nhs_new_flightevents.8.d:0 "An Ottoman prince, born here in exile after his grandfather's defeat in a failed attempt for the Ottoman throne, has heard of our plans to quit the City of the World's Desire and sail to Vinland. The man, Orhan Çelebi, was never returned to the Ottoman Empire on the implied threat of execution for his grandfather's crimes. Needless to say, he fears such a punishment at the hands of his cousin, Mehmed, and has requested that a ship be allocated to him and his regiment of retainers. In return, he promises to train the Roman army, such as it is, in the advanced tactics of the feared Janissary corps, and also offers his personal service as a general in Roman service. In addition, a former Ottoman officer named Gjerj Kastrioti, called Skanderbeg, has rebelled from Turkish service and has travelled to the City in search of support. He has also learned of our impending flight and requests that some of his people be allowed on board. Unfortunately, there's only enough space left on our transports for one group: either Skanderbeg or Orhan Çelebi must stay behind in the doomed city. Both men have promised to not share our plans to our enemies, come what may."

 nhs_new_flightevents.9.d:0 "Hearing of the approach of our fleet, a large Granadan force drew up near the Gates of Herakles to force us to pay for safe passage. Enticed by the promise of loot, a contingent from Morocco also sailed in support of the Granadan fleet. We could pay the toll, or we could force the strait with a sea battle. We might still take losses, but the Roman navy is still one of the best in the Mediterranean..."

 nhs_new_flightevents.10.d:0 "Two Portuguese ships sailed near our fleet today with an envoy. Their leader states that one of the ships and accompanying supplies can be used by us on our travels if we agree to share our discoveries with them. They are under the impression we are heading south to explore the coasts of Africa. One of our advisors suggested that we use this opportunity to trick the nations of Europe, making them believe that we were caught up in a series of increasingly treacherous storms filled with sea monsters and that our last act was to inform them. That way, it might take some generations before their curiosity returns. Alternatively, we could inform the Portuguese of our true intentions, providing us with a potential future ally in Europe."
 nhs_new_flightevents.10.a:0 "A good catch, send them the fraudulent message!"

 nhs_new_flightevents.14.d:0 "The storm lies a few days behind us now, leaving many at the edge of despair. A cleric asked to see you, and you invited him into your quarters. He's a very charismatic man, capable of inspiring men in the face of death, and he served us well in the armies fighting against the Ottomans. So it seems strange that he of all men would suggest such a thing: return to worshipping the Old Gods, the Roman and Hellenic Gods. He says he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he states that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon. If there are Gods, he continued, they must be as flawed and ill-tempered as the old Hellenic Gods. We would do best to appease them, rather than speak to a God that may listen, but seems not to care."

Truly, such a verdant land beyond the Pillars of Herakles can only be the Elysium from ancient myth! It is only now, however, that the cost becomes apparent: Every scrap of technology; every single book from the Imperial Library; every scroll detailing schematics or architecture or mathematics is one less bushel of wheat or one less person we could've taken. On top of that, the Ottoman Turks have probably already invaded what's left of our home the minute we stripped the garrisons and set sail."

Our opportunistic attempts to invade and take the throne of the Romans, however, were blocked by a spirited defence of the walls, led by a certain Orhan Çelebi, prince of Osman's venerable line.

The prince requests a temporary alliance to check the ambitions of his cousin, the Ottoman Sultan, and promises to cede land to us if the coalition is victorious.
