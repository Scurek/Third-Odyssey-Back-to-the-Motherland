They are requesting our aid in building a large network of aqueducts in the Appalachian Mountains to bring water to our capital and the surrounding countryside. This water would be used for farming, public baths and our new sewage system, and as a result we could produce more and colonize faster. As for construction, four plans have been proposed to us by our architects: \n1. [936.GetName]-[949.GetName]-[2011.GetName]-[2550.GetName]-[953.GetName] \n2.

 nhs2_nativesevents.2.d:0 "Our higher nobility have adopted the new technological methods given to us by the Exiles, as well as parts of Elysian culture, surprisingly fast. This was actually a process that has been going on for many years; however, in doing so they are alienating themselves from the general populace.

An idea of unity among the tribes is starting to take shape. While it is difficult to tell where these new movements will lead it seems that the first step is the assimilation of minor tribes.

 nhs2_countryevents.20.d:0 "In the years since our flight from Europe and subsequent landing in this new world, the people of Elysia have never forgotten Ioannes VIII, the last Byzantine emperor, and his brother Konstantinos XI, the first Elysian emperor. A favourite story told by the common people is that one day so called 'Marble Emperors' will return and deliver Palia Constantinople back into Elysian hands. The peasants and merchants of Neo Konstantinoupolis are calling for a great statue to be built in the forum that shows their triumphant return, made of marble of course."

There is a debate occurring among the people on the usefulness of repairing the fleet at all, as it will be expensive to repair and maintain. The alternative is that we break down the ships for wood, which we can then use to help build the local infrastructure such as roads and housing, or for building a basic wooden palisade around the settlement to help protect us from native incursions."

The overseers that run these projects are requesting more workers, however, there are not enough for all of them. Where should send the peasants?"

 nhs2_countryevents.25.d:0 "The aristocracy that ventured west with us has grown increasingly concerned about small-scale raids by the red-skinned barbarians native to this land. To that end, they have begun recruiting small bands of their kith and kin to defend the Roman holdings and conduct counter-raids. By appointing a general unconnected with the aristocracy, these small-scale militias can easily be turned into a unified force, and the only question that remains is where to best deploy them."

As we are currently limited in resources, we can only build a basic temple using wood and stone. The Emperor's advisers remind him that if he paid for it out of his own treasury, he would have increased control over where the temple's tax income is invested."

If we agree to limit Neo Konstantinoupolis' outward growth for now and therefore leave their towns intact, they are willing to provide our people with some men and resources. Alternatively, we could just take their land for ourselves, but this would cause an uproar among the natives still living there."

Indeed, our alchemists and engineers have plans to improve the range and reliability of both ship mounted and handheld variants using more modern techniques and materials.

Wary of travelling too far west, the Portuguese and to a lesser extent the Spanish established a number of small trading posts along the coast of West Africa, trading with the kingdoms there for gold and salt. As a result, the kingdoms of Europe are relatively poor, being largely cut out of the spice market by the Ottomans. However, our rediscovery has led to a renewed drive to explore both the new world and to find another route to the riches of India."

However despite their interest, many European explorers avoid Elysian territory, wary of a people they had long thought perished at sea. Sensing a unique opportunity, many Elysian ports are opening their doors, offering preferential treatment to European merchants. While we could allow this open trade policy to continue, the Elysian state and its predecessors have traditionally held tight control over foreign trade."

 nhs2_countryevents.52.d:0 "A small fleet of Portuguese ships were discovered off our shores today. After anchoring off the coast of one of our major port cities, we received a group of emissaries, one of whom spoke some Greek, which was close enough to Elysian that we could converse. They say that while most of Europe had given up on finding a new route to India after our supposed demise, the Portuguese used the knowledge we had given them and continued to send secret expeditions west in search of our fleet. They offer us a unique proposition, in return for exclusive access to our more exotic trade goods, they will introduce us to new technological advances from Europe. Of course, we could just prevent them from leaving and take their supplies for ourselves, though that won't stop them from sending more ships."

Recent breakthroughs in ship design have allowed them to explore and map the northern coastline of the great continent to the south. The Elysian senate is wary of unchecked Portuguese expansion, and as such has invited them to sign the 'Treaty of Lathanopolis', which would restrict Portuguese settlement to that continent. In return, their colony would receive the protection of the Elysian navy in addition to regular supply shipments. Alternatively we could allow them to settle wherever they wish, which would no doubt ingratiate them to us if nothing else."
