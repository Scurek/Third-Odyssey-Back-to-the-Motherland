 byzantine_demise:0 "Byzantine Demise"
 desc_byzantine_demise:0 "The last Byzantine Emperor and his great expedition met their doom at the end of the world. They were honourable enough to release a messenger pigeon, a gift from the Portuguese during their travels, to warn us when they realised they could not escape their doom. The demise of the last continuation of the Roman Empire has put off nations and explorers in all of Europe. There are some though that believe the Byzantines survived, and eagerness to explore may come back in the future. For now though, no sane person will jump on the opportunity."

 desc_friend_with_natives:0 "We have made friends with some of the local clans and can call upon their help in supplying the manpower we so dearly need and lack."

 desc_friend_with_natives_2:0 "We have made friends with some of the local clans and can call upon their help in supplying the manpower we so dearly need and lack."
 friend_with_nhs:0 "Roman Contacts"
 desc_friend_with_nhs:0 "We have chosen to align ourselves with the great tribe of white men from across the sea, either by establishing good relations or taking their gods as our own. Hopefully they will share some of their knowledge with us."
 home_slaver_state:0 "Slaver State"
 desc_home_slaver_state:0 "We are well known to promote enslavement and slave trade throughout our entire nation, and don't shun harsh, almost barbaric treatment of those we consider inferior. This is a great boon to our economy and brings an even more luxurious lifestyle for the wealthy, but other nations look at us with disgust because of the public displays of cruelty found a plenty - even in our prestigious capital."
 nhs_renegade_kingdom:0 "Elysian Renegade Kingdom"
 desc_nhs_renegade_kingdom:0 "Our claim to independence stands weak as a fragment of the Elysian empire. Unless we act as a client kingdom of the Emperor or can claim the throne of Emperor our people will never consider us legitimate. The only way to solve this is to conquer or be conquered!"
 nhs_lacking_gunpowder:0 "Lacking Modern Gunpowder Technology"
 desc_nhs_lacking_gunpowder:0 "The exiled Romans took with them much knowledge, gunpowder among it; but at the time, gunpowder was not used frequently and certainly not for infantry. We have tried to catch up to the Europeans using the crude knowledge of gunpowder and weaponry that was known to the exiles, but this has been found lacking. We must investigate current European weaponry and acquire the refined recipes for the gunpowder they use." 

 byz_flight_nhs_title:0 "To A New World!"
 byz_flight_nhs_desc:0 "The time of the Romans has faded in Europe, our only hope is to follow our ancestor's footsteps and found a new empire before we fall to the Turks!"
 nhs_reestablish_merchant_class_title:0 "Re-establish the Merchant Class"
 nhs_reestablish_merchant_class_desc:0 "We have long been without merchants to trade with the natives. We can only solve this problem if we encourage entrepreneurs to establish themselves as merchants. It'll take a lot of effort, and the country must be ready for it, but it will pay off in the long run."
 nhs_form_colonial_institution_title:0 "Form A Colonial Institution"
 nhs_form_colonial_institution_desc:0 "We have long struggled to organise the settling of more distant lands. This can change though: we are experienced at seafaring and settling new lands, all we need is a strong national institution to oversee and organise our colonisation programs. With such organisation and our strong traditions we will be unmatched at claiming new ground. For the glory of Elysia!"
 nhs_summon_militia_title:0 "Summon the Militia"
 nhs_summon_militia_desc:0 "In times of war, we can call on the local population to bolster our armies. This does bring along economic setbacks though, so use them with care."
 nhs_modernize_title:0 "Modernize the Realm"
 nhs_modernize_desc:0 "It has been clear for some time: we are stagnating. Our realm has become complacent, sure as we are of our dominance over the local Barbaroi. The advisors are clear when they claim that stagnation leads only to a slow death. Such, they claim, was witnessed in the old empire in Europe. Only by introducing reforms and investing in radical new technologies can we fight off the looming spectre of a slow death."
 nhs_grand_harbour_title:0 "Construct a Grand Cothon"
 nhs_grand_harbour_desc:0 "Scholars have discovered a Hellenistic book dating back to before the destruction of Carthage describing the architecture of their famous grand harbour, known as a Cothon. Some scholars suggest this is mostly made up or originates primarily from aggrandised stories, as ancient historians had a tendency to do. Nevertheless, the design seems very interesting and building a great new harbour district would boost the wealth of our ports in Didymo Fylakes tremendously since demand for trade is rising steadily."
 nhs_construct_hippodrome_title:0 "Construct a Hippodrome"
 nhs_construct_hippodrome_desc:0 "We have come up with the ingenious idea to construct a solid track with stone tribunes to hold chariot races. Why is that so great? It would stimulate the breeding of horses, fine strong horses that are fast and can pull weight. And even better, the people simply love it, especially when the drivers crash against the side of the track! I must admit it makes me giggle a bit as well, after feeling bad for the drivers of course..."
 nhs_establish_census_system_title:0 "Establish Census System"
 nhs_establish_census_system_desc:0 "It is hard to keep track of who lives where and thus have an idea of how much people there are that must pay taxes. It would also help to track down the men ready for service should they be required in times of need. Holding a census every decade or so may cause some friction, but would decrease the impact of tax dodging and corrupt collectors significantly."
 nhs_found_grand_library_title:0 "Found an Alexandrian Library"
 nhs_found_grand_library_desc:0 "The original library of Alexandria, which probably contained many great works of which no copies exist to date, was destroyed in a fire in dubious circumstances. It is possible the rising Christians caused this to happen during religious conflicts with pagan philosophers, but historical records tend to favor the victor; or, in contrast, contemporary losers might criminalise them out of spite. Whatever the case, much was lost that day. We do now have a rather large selection of works, old and new, and it might be beneficial to open up a library to the public; with adjacent educational institutes, we may encourage even greater scientific advancement."
 nhs_alexandrian_paper_tt:0 "If you have completed §YWonders of Elysium§!, change province trade good §YPaper§!."
 nhs_cheaper_library_tt:0 "§GPrinting press has made the construction much cheaper§!"

 nhs_hellenise_title:0 "Hellenise the Country"
 nhs_hellenise_desc:0 "We have encountered the exiles from Hellas and their technological methods. They exceed us greatly in all knowledge, we should adopt their methods to avoid being outcompeted and destroyed over time!"
 nhs_claim_elysian_throne_title:0 "Claim the Elysian Throne"
 nhs_claim_elysian_throne_desc:0 "We have control of Elysia and are in a position where we can legitimately claim the Elysian throne. From here on out, we control the Imperial seat!"
 nhs_restore_toll_modifier_title:0 "Reinstate the Seagate Toll"
 nhs_restore_toll_modifier_desc:0 "Once control over the bay and Elysian Homelands is restored, it will once again become profitable to demand toll from every ship passing through the Seagate strait."
 nhs_restore_gilded_keep_title:0 "Renovate the Gilded Keep"
 nhs_restore_gilded_keep_desc:0 "The keep may have been plundered of its riches, but most of the infrastructure is still there. All that is needed to restore the Gilded Keep to its former glory is a whole lot of gold."
 nhs_restore_carthaginian_design_harbour_title:0 "Repair the Grand Cothon"
 nhs_restore_carthaginian_design_harbour_desc:0 "The Carthaginian-style harbour of New Constantinople may have become deserted, but with a reasonably small investment it could be restored to its original state and be safe to accept trade ships and work on our navy once more."
 nhs_restore_seagate_guardians_title:0 "Rebuild the Seagate Guardians"
 nhs_restore_seagate_guardians_desc:0 "The large statues may have decayed too much to be restored, but many of the paths, workplaces, and the local quarry are still intact. Our artists may need to partially redesign the statues since most of them are missing, but it shouldn't be that costly to construct new replicas compared to the cost it must have had in the past."
 nhs_restore_alexandrian_library_title:0 "Reform the Alexandrian Library"
 nhs_restore_alexandrian_library_desc:0 "The old library may have been pillaged or burned down, leaving nothing more but ashes and rubble in most places, but enough of the main building and most of the adjacent colleges are still intact to easily restore the place to its former glory. The biggest issue is finding the copies or original books to fill the library with. Thankfully, the Royal Library already has a selection of works, both copies from the past and new items collected."
 nhs_restore_hippodrome_title:0 "Rebuild the Hippodrome"
 nhs_restore_hippodrome_desc:0 "One can still see clearly where the races must have been held. The track is overgrown and many of the tribunes are gone. The most significant remainder is a stable and a converted stable house used as an inn. I don't think the innkeeper would complain if we confiscated his lot for twice the market price."
 nhs_restore_silk_quarter_title:0 "Reorganise the Silk Quarter"
 nhs_restore_silk_quarter_desc:0 "The old silk quarter has become part of the city like any other. It houses families, workshops, shops... Silk production is still present, but inefficient and of low quality. We need to return it to a walled off quarter, reorganise the production process and rehouse the families if we want to reclaim production of the world's finest silk."

 seagate_guardian_statues_desc:0 "With solid control over the sea passage to our capital there are many who believe we should cement this dominance and make a lasting testament of our glory that can be seen by every ship that passes through Seagate. Several plans have already been made up for giant stone statues of guardians, doubling as lighthouses, to be built at the sides of the bay. The glorious nation of Elysia deserves a glorious entryway!"
