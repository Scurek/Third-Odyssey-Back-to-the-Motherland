 understandings_with_natives:0 "Understandings with Natives"
 understandings_with_natives_desc:0 "As strangers exiled to these foreign lands, we can only prosper if we work with those that understand these lands. Like the old Romans and Sabines, we can once more become whole. This idea unlocks various options and events, and facilitates friendship with natives."
 reworked_codex_justinianus:0 "Reworked Codex Justinianus"
 reworked_codex_justinianus_desc:0 "We have inherited traditions of justice far beyond those of the barbarian primitives that invaded our lands in the distant past. We must further these traditions, since they led to stability where lesser nations would have fallen."
 inspired_recruits:0 "Inspired Recruits"
 inspired_recruits_desc:0 "The armies of our nation benefit from the works of great leaders and military manuals. Let all our officers and generals study them, so they know how to inspire troops both before battle and during peace."
 constantinople_never_again:0 "Never Again Falter"
 constantinople_never_again_desc:0 "In their moment of prosperity the Romans lost focus on their defences, watering down the armies with poorly trained foreign recruits until hardly any of the elite Roman forces remained. With the decline of both our ancestor empires we must be aware of this, and never drop our guard!"
 defend_our_new_wealth:0 "Defend our Newfound Wealth"
 defend_our_new_wealth_desc:0 "Since we came to these foreign lands, we have made much progress. We must ensure that this benefits our citizens and merchants first, as it is they who fought so hard to re-establish our illustrious empire."
 philosophic_tradition:0 "Philosophic Traditions"
 philosophic_tradition_desc:0 "Our last strongholds were held in the cradle of civilisation, Hellas - Greece. Over time many Romans added to the already rich Hellenistic thought. Honouring these traditions we will support innovativeness beyond imagining in our Empire."
 senate_of_cities:0 "Found a Senate of Cities"
 senate_of_cities_desc:0 "In the past the senate was made up of aristocratic or later on plebeian citizens of Rome, while governors dictated the management of other cities and provinces. If we instil a sense of dignity in each city its population will be more likely to support the nation as a whole. Let us gather senators from every major city!"

 senatorial_empire_ruler_female:0 "Empress"
 senatorial_empire_desc:0 "A government led by an Emperor, a title passed down from father to son, but with substantial power given to a senate or people's meeting. The Emperor is recognised as leader, but has a hard time carrying out any decisions. He does benefit from easier management of the empire due to delegating power to the senate. A large empire is thus less likely to fall apart."

 elysian_empire_ruler_female:0 "Empress"
 elysian_empire_desc:0 "The Elysian Empire is ruled almost exclusively by its Emperor. He keeps the country together by sheer willpower, if he is sufficiently capable. Ruling in a new land with little infrastructure and a lot of wilderness does not bode well for this type of government."

 elysian_peoples_republic_desc:0 "Some Elysian offspring nations established something known to us as a 'Cities' Republic'. Similar to the Elysian Empire there would be one capital city with a grand council, in which councillors would represent the minor councils of various other grand cities. Instead of an Emperor, though, they would appoint a six-year-term Head Councillor to proceed in all matters regarding foreign relations and would have the deciding vote if things ever got down to it."

 BOOKMARK_FLIGHT_OF_THE_BYZANTINES:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 BOOKMARK_FLIGHT_OF_THE_BYZANTINES_DESC:0 "Experience an alternate history, where the emperor of Byzantium ponders the state of the realm. Gradually his appreciation for the works written about the fall of Troy and the adventures of its heroes increases and it inspires him to consider a bold move. Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey faced hardships on his way back home. Aeneas in Vergil's Aeneid was forced to flee the city and was led by Jupiter and Venus to found the city Lavinium after a great Odyssey of his own. This city would later be known as the city from which Romulus and Remus's mother originated. Now it is time for the Byzantines to embark on the Third Odyssey... will you lead the faltering Greeks to a New World?\n\n\nScenario created by Lichtkang, only available as Byzantium before 1445."
