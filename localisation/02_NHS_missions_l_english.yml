Members of the imperial family have requested that the mosaic prominently show celebrated emperors and empresses of times past, including our founders, Ioannes and Constantine.

Though we build it in honour of the gods, we shall name it after the the Marble Kings, those two brothers who led us to Elysium, so that we do not forget their legacy. As such, statues of Ioannes VIII and his brother Constantine XI will be prominently displayed alongside those of the Olympian gods. Now all that is left to do is to decide a location."

 nhs_mission_events.121.d:0 "As the construction on the grand temple continues, an influential assembly of Barbaroi with members from around the empire request an audience. They ask if we willing to include an alcove within the temple dedicated to a number of local deities for which there is no true Roman equivalent. While this would of course gain the favour of the Barbaroi, it would likely upset the High Priesthood, who largely believe in the assimilation of native gods into the Elysian pantheon."
 nhs_mission_events.121.a:0 "Very well, we will give the Barbaroi their alcove."

 nhs_mission_events.131.d:0 "The great Temple of the Marble Emperors has finally been completed. Hearkening back to the Parthenon of Athens, the Temple is surrounded by Doric columns with a double row at each end. The triangular pediments on the front and back face of the temple are adorned with sculptures depicting the Gods of Olympus as they guide our ancestors to this new land, with a focus on Poseidon as he leads the fleet west. Within the inner chamber or naos stands a large marble and gold statue of Ioannes VIII as he imparts to Constantine XI his final words. Truly, those who look upon it are in awe of the power of the Olympian Gods."
