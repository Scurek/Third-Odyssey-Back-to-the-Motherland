 ELYINFNAME01:0 "The Second Elysian Civil War"
 ELYINFDESC01:0 "Ever since the Elysian Revolution abolished the office of Emperor and established the Elysian Republic, men from across the nation have enjoyed the privilege of electing their senators. The old aristocracy, however, is not content with peacefully surrendering their power, and is attempting to covertly subvert the republic into an oligarchy via rigged elections. Elysians everywhere are outraged by this, and the nation seems to be plunging toward a second civil war."

 ELYINFNAME05:0 "Republican Activity in [inf_oligarchy_crackdown_province.GetName]"
 ELYINFDESC05:0 "We have received reports of Republican activity in [inf_oligarchy_crackdown_province.GetName]. We could perform a harsh crackdown on the province to send a message to the Republicans, or we could more subtly investigate the reports and arrest those involved."

The leaders of the Dynatoi and the Republicans have met and acknowledged that the war is at a standstill, and the best thing for the nation is peace. To that end, they signed a peace treaty promising the restoration of the First Republic"

 elysian_infighting.10.d:0 "The once-pristine marble floors of the old Imperial Palace have been soaked in blood! Large crowds have gathered to witness the execution of the Dynatoi - those aristocratic pretenders who dared say they governed in the name of the people! Some went with stoic grace, and some pleaded, but all died in the end. Now, the blood has barely had time to dry, and already Elysians are flocking to the building to cast their vote for a true leader who will govern in the name of the people."

The old Emperor is deposed, reduced to begging in foreign courts; the Dynatoi are dead or impoverished; the commoners reign supreme, the only place in the world where this can be said. We welcome these would-be revolutionaries with open arms!"
 elysian_infighting.11.a:0 "The old order is dead forever!"
 nhs_already_exists_rev_tt:0 "It seems we are not the first people to rise up against the tyranny of Kings, Emperors and decadent Aristocrats. The citizens of [nhs_rev_target.GetName] have also recently established a republic of their own, and now seek to spread the revolution to the nations of the world, so that all may live as free men! Shall we unite in support of our fellow revolutionary republic or denounce them as traitors to true freedom and democracy."
