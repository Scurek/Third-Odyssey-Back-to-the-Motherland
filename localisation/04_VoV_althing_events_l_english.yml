 nhs_vov_althingevents.1.t:0 "Althing of Vinland"
 nhs_vov_althingevents.1.d:0 "After many years alone and fragmented, we have finally been able to fulfil Leif's dream of a peaceful and united Vinland, for our lands now range from the sacred 'Leiflending' to the coasts of 'Helluland', giving us absolute control over Eiriksson Gulf.\n\nSo it was decided, by both the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and it's council, that along with the great title of 'Vinland' we would also bring back the ruling system of old, the 'Althing', where the most powerful and influential free men of the country both elect and share the administrative power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nThis was done mostly to appease the increasing number of free men and thanes throughout the nation and avoid any possible insurrection from the most distant colonies."

 nhs_vov_althingevents.30.t:0 "Norse Religion Reformed"
 nhs_vov_althingevents.30.d:0 "The ancient Norse religion is proving unable to withstand the pressure from the gods of the south. Rather than abandoning the old ways, a great conclave of gothar were assembled to reform the faith. A holy scripture was written with codified rites and a new strict church hierarchy was formed. Hopefully this new centralized religious structure will help us fight back against the weak and effeminate foreign beliefs!"

 nhs_vov_althingevents.47.d:0 "Due to our lack of investment towards the Gothar, many of them are starting to close their doors to us, refusing to serve in official religious practices or simply refusing to aid internal growth."
 nhs_vov_althingevents.47.a:0 "They will still change with time."
 nhs_vov_althingevents.50.t:0 "Shady Deals Between Free Men"
 nhs_vov_althingevents.50.d:0 "Whispers and lies have unfortunately become a staple of the Althing, with many of the more powerful free men openly trading favours inside the Althing's halls.\nThis sort of behaviour must be stopped and the Althing must be brought to it's former pristine self!"
