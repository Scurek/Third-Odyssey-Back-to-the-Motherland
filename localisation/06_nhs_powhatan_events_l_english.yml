 nhs2_powhatan_deal_title:0 "Deal with the Powhatan"
 nhs2_powhatan_deal_desc:0 "It's a rare opportunity to do diplomacy with the native peoples, but now we have a chance to avoid war. If we could provide the Powhatan with a generous gift of gold and weapons we can convince them to leave their current land and move further south, away from our claimed territory."
 nhs_powhatan_deal.2.t:0 "Elysians Offer Deal"
 nhs_powhatan_deal.2.d:0 "A diplomat from the rapidly expanding Elysian nation has offered us a deal. He has a large amount of gold and weapons for us, and in exchange for that he asks us to leave \"rightful Elysian territory\". Not only will this give us an advantage against the tribes, but we can prevent (or at least delay) war with the foreigners."
 nhs_powhatan_deal.2.a:0 "Sounds like a good deal."
 nhs_powhatan_deal.2.b:0 "If they want our land they can take it!"
 nhs_powhatan_deal.3.t:0 "Deal Accepted"
 nhs_powhatan_deal.3.d:0 "The Powhatan have accepted our deal. Their villages, now equipped with crossbows and light iron armour, are packing up and marching south as we speak, while Elysian settlers move in to take their place."
 nhs_powhatan_deal.4.t:0 "Deal Refused"
 nhs_powhatan_deal.4.d:0 "The Powhatan have refused our deal. At least they had the decency to send back the gift, but clearly war is inevitable."
 nhs2_settling:0 "Building Settlement"
 desc_nhs2_settling:0 "As we only recently acquired the province, our settlers are still left constructing base foundations of a settlement."
 nhs_has_empty_n_province_pow:0 "There is a province they can migrate to."
