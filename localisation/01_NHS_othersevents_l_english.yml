 nhs_othersevents.1.t:0 "Deal with the Byzantines"
 nhs_othersevents.1.d:0 "The Emperor of Constantinople has offered us a deal that could not be refused. In exchange for a one-time payment of ships or coin they have granted our ships free passage through the Bosphorus. We have placed an official to ensure the ships flying our flag are truly ours."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME1:0 "Excellent, send the Emperor our gratitude!"
 nhs_othersevents.2.t:0 "Deal for Peloponnese"
 nhs_othersevents.2.d:0 "In light of the Ottoman advance, the Emperor of Constantinople has sought fit to propose us a tempting deal: in exchange for a one-time payment in coin and ships we will receive control over the ports and cities of the Peloponnese! Not full control, of course, and not for forever according to the agreement, but this gives us better capacity to compete now the Genoese merchants have received free passage through the Bosphorus to their trade posts in the Black Sea. This deal will last twenty years."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME2:0 "A deal worth taking!"
 nhs_othersevents.3.t:0 "The Salute of the Byzantines"
 nhs_othersevents.3.d:0 "Our ships have been sent out to extort toll from the large Byzantine expedition on their way to open sea. The Emperor himself is on board, so surely they won't dare risk his life, especially not against a Granadan-Moroccan coalition! We should receive word soon as to what the result of the encounter is."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME3A:0 "They sunk our fleet!"
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME3B:0 "The fleet returns victorious!"
 nhs_othersevents.4.t:0 "The last Sighting of the Byzantines"
 nhs_othersevents.4.d:0 "We heard a large expedition from Byzantium, carrying the Emperor himself, had set out to seek new land. Because of our own ambitions overseas we gifted them a fine sea-faring ship in exchange for the completion of a simple task: the Byzantines had to share their knowledge with us of what lies beyond. Even the Moroccans have little knowledge of the lands beyond the desert, but we had suspicions there is more than just sand. A few months later a pigeon found its way back, carrying the last message ever received from the Roman bloodline: a letter of warning. At time of writing their ships were unable to escape certain doom at the end of the world when the dropping water dragged them along. Though some doubt these words, the fact is none have returned from that far, and it will take a long time before explorers will go out again!"
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME4:0 "A tragic tale..."
 nhs_othersevents.5.t:0 "Taking control of the Peloponnese"
 nhs_othersevents.5.d:0 "The Emperor seems to be redistributing power in exchange for financial support. With all the ongoing trouble our nobles have grown unruly and demanded more power of their own. In response, the Emperor has given our nobles direct lordship over the minor lords of the Peloponnese, they have now sworn fealty to us first, to the Emperor second. They now obey him only through us."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME5:0 "Excellent! Send the Emperor a gift to show our gratitude!"
 nhs_othersevents.6.t:0 "Unrest among our Nobles"
 nhs_othersevents.6.d:0 "With the redistribution of power in the Peloponnese to the Venetians our nobles have become outraged! To have these pompous Italian peasants running the land right next to us is an utter disgrace! Has the Emperor forgotten about the Venetian-inspired invasion of the Empire? In an effort to soothe our worries the Emperor has been forced to hand us a substantial portion of the one-time payment of the merchants for their temporary control of the peninsula."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME6:0 "Money will have to do."
 nhs_othersevents.7.t:0 "End of Contract"
 nhs_othersevents.7.d:0 "Even though the Emperor has perished, the nobles of the Peloponnese have been loyal to the agreement we had with them. This agreement has now run its course and the nobles are not willing to renew it. With the disappearance of the Emperor the road lies open to claiming the Byzantine throne themselves. Maybe they have been blind for the Ottoman power with our protection, or maybe their ambition will pay off, but either way we no longer have direct control of the peninsula. Some of our advisors have suggested that since the Emperor is dead our temporary agreement should in fact be considered permanent, and suggest we press our claims on the peninsula."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME7:0 "Let us consider our next move carefully."
 nhs_othersevents.8.t:0 "End of Subjugation"
 nhs_othersevents.8.d:0 "The agreement our late Emperor made with the Venetians has run its course. Since the Emperor has died we could lay claim to the throne of Constantinople now that we're rid of those Venetian peasants. Whatever we do, we will do it alone. The Venetians dared propose a continuation of our humiliating contract, we should be wary they do not try to take control of the peninsula some other way..."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME8:0 "Freedom at last!"
 nhs_othersevents.9.t:0 "Decay of Splendour"
 nhs_othersevents.9.d:0 "One of our cities in the ancient Elysian homelands has suffered a series of setbacks. Replacing the Elysian governance with people loyal to us meant that the city has been mismanaged for quite some time. Mismanagement led to a bad economy, a steady decrease in population and a rise in crime accompanied by a limited treasury to adequately manage city affairs. As was often the case in those scenarios, the city population resorted to cannibalising materials and riches from older, hardly utilised places. The governor of the city has shared the spoils from one of those large operations with you in order to appease the possible outrage such devastation could evoke. And outraged you should be indeed, since glorious monuments have become prime targets for these operations to keep the city going."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME9:0 "Well, at least they shared."
 nhs_othersevents.10.t:0 "Byzantines Trust"
 nhs_othersevents.10.d:0 "We have heard that a large expedition from Byzantium, carrying the Emperor himself, had set out to seek new lands across the ocean. Because of our own ambitions overseas we gifted them a fine sea-faring ship in exchange for the completion of a simple task: the Byzantines had to share their knowledge with us of what lies beyond. We have little knowledge of what lies beyond the great western horizon, only that there may a new route to the rich trade routes of India. A few months later a pigeon found its way back, carrying two messages. The first, addressed to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, states that the Byzantines were able to survive a great storm despite heavy losses and that they had spotted flocks of seabirds, a sure sign that land is nearby. The second is a fabricated account of their voyage addressed to the nations of Europe, informing them that the Byzantines had perished in a series of giant storms and endless ocean. Armed with this exclusive information, we will begin sending out secret expeditions west as soon as possible, with the hope of eventually finding the Byzantines."
 nhs_othersevents.10.a:0 "The search begins!"
 nhs_othersevents.51.t:0 "Lost at Sea"
 nhs_othersevents.51.d:0 "Stranded at a small archipelago we may very well be the last survivors of the Roman expedition. A storm caught us by surprise and probably sunk the entire fleet, apart from our ship. Are we really all that's left? Across the islands we have collected a good few hundred survivors and supplies. After setting up basic shelters we held a grand meeting and decided that we'd elect a new leader every few years or when the previous one has died. We've got basic tools, some supplies and a few ships that can be used for fishing, let's make the best of it!"
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME51:0 "There's a lot of work ahead of us."
 nhs_othersevents.52.t:0 "Our Brethren!"
 nhs_othersevents.52.d:0 "We have encountered our long lost brethren, who we thought perished in the storm. They seem to have found large, new lands only scarcely populated by natives. Thank God, there is so much to discuss, make preparations for a feast with whatever we can gather, prepare the island for the arrival of the Emperor!"
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME52:0 "What a glorious day!"
 nhs_othersevents.53.t:0 "Left on our Own"
 nhs_othersevents.53.d:0 "The Emperor and his retinue returned home unwilling to accept us in his realm. Perhaps because we are such a poor lot, or perhaps because of religious differences, but whatever the case we are on our own again. At least now we know there's more out there to settle..."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME53:0 "Betrayal, nothing but treachery!"
 nhs_othersevents.54.t:0 "Expansionary Efforts"
 nhs_othersevents.54.da:0 "Left on our own, we had no other option but to set off for new lands. About half of our people had gathered ships and supplies and set forth for new lands. If their journey was unsuccessful, at least we'd be able to support the numbers left on the island. But we were lucky, the expedition has struck rich new lands and established a new settlement! Already work is underway to expand even further. What will the future bring for the Stranded People?"
 nhs_othersevents.54.db:0 "With Elysian support we now sail south to establish new settlement on the rich isles of Kykladia."
 NHSOTHERSEVENTSNAME54:0 "A new world awaits!"
 nhs_othersevents.101.t:0 "A New Power"
 nhs_othersevents.101.d:0 "Our loyal subjects now have a chance to prove themselves. As we declare independence, they follow. Some are willing to die for their country's ideals, others follow out of their own interests or thanks to the seductive powers of gold and silver."
