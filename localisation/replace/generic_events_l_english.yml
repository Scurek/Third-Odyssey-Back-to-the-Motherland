They consider [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] manners foreign and strange. While some distrust to a new ruler is only natural it seems that for the time being our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will mostly have supporters at court, where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] surrounds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with [Root.new_ruler_culture.GetCultureName] friends from foreign lands."
