They consider [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] manners foreign and strange. While some distrust to a new ruler is only natural it seems that for the time being our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will mostly have supporters at court, where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] surrounds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with [Root.new_ruler_culture.GetCultureName] friends from foreign lands."
 institution_events.3.da:0 "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonisers and the colonised. This has led to a spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vast size of the globe. Animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Eirenic the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy. As foreign lands and people are mapped and documented ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate has become more and more coloured by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth and from [From.GetCapitalName] to Fatehpur Sikri the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 institution_events.5.d:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of Elysium and Retoria, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Eirenic Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly global economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."
