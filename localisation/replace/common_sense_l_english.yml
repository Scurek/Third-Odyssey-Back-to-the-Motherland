 alert_lack_of_parliament_debate_delayed:0 "Not having an ongoing debate has the following effects on your nation:"
 desc_rotten_borough:0 "This province has a seat in the [Root.GetSenateParliment] despite being of relative unimportance. This has allowed those with power in the area to control the votes as the voters are few enough and poor enough to be easily manipulated."
 parliamentary_scandal:0 "[Root.GetCapSenatorialParlimentary] Scandal"
 desc_parliamentary_scandal:0 "The capital is shaken by the actions of a visiting [Root.GetSenatorMP] and the inability of the state to punish him for his conduct."
 desc_yearning_for_representation:0 "Recent developments have led to the people of this country to hope for a representative assembly and a written constitution."
 parlaments.2.a:0 "Rotten!"
 parlaments.2.a.tt:0 "This [Root.GetSenatorialParlimentary] seat will change its voting pattern from now on."
 parlaments.2.b:0 "We must reassign the seat."
 parlaments.4.t:0 "Corruption of Vote"
 parlaments.4.d:0 "The [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of the rotten boroughs in [Root.GetName] have chosen to oppose our proposal in [Root.GetCapSenateParliment]. It seems the landowner who controls the area has been persuaded that the issue is not in his best interest."
 parlaments.4.a:0 "Rotters!"
 parlaments.4.b:0 "We must bribe the landowner then."
 parlaments.5.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.5.d:0 "The influential University of [Root.GetCapitalName] has managed to sway the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of [Root.GetName] to come out in favour of increasing University funding."
 parlaments.5.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.6.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.6.d:0 "Apart from having a [Root.GetSenatorialParlimentary] seat, [Root.GetName] is also the centre of a number of influential companies with a stake in overseas trade. It appears many of these have decided that they would benefit from the currently debated issue being implemented and have exerted pressure on their [Root.GetSenatorMP]s to make it so."
 parlaments.6.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.7.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.7.d:0 "The army is in many ways the most influential internal force in [Root.GetName] and their loyalty to that organization has persuaded the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s from this seat to vote in favour of the current issue out of loyalty."
 parlaments.7.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.8.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.8.d:0 "The current Root.GetSenatorialParlimentary debate on how to best protect domestic production has attracted the attention of many in [Root.GetName]. This Root.GetSenatorialParlimentary seat has come to support us in the debate, in the hope that it will benefit from the suggested policy."
 parlaments.8.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.9.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.9.d:0 "As the seat of our capital the province of [Root.GetName] stands to benefit a lot from the currently proposed reforms. Luckily enough people have realized this to ensure that the seat is now voting in our favour."
 parlaments.9.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.10.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.10.d:0 "It seems the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of the seat of [Root.GetName] have realised how beneficial the currently debated issue would be to them. Their support for our cause is most welcome."
 parlaments.10.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.11.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.11.d:0 "It seems the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of the seat of [Root.GetName], staunch supporters of our cause just a little while ago, have come to change their opinion of the currently debated issue entirely. We cannot know for sure how this happened but is clear that we can no longer rely on their vote."
 parlaments.11.a:0 "Greed is a horrible thing."
 parlaments.12.t:0 "Rotten Borough"
 parlaments.12.d:0 "While it looked like the vote of [Root.GetName] would in fact come out in support of the currently proposed reform to eliminate the rotten boroughs in [Root.GetCapSenateParliment] it seems whoever supported the [Root.GetSenatorMP] in the area suddenly realised that he was about to lose his seat. He has now managed to convince the [Root.GetSenatorMP] to vote against our reform."
 parlaments.12.a:0 "Rotten!"
 parlaments.13.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.13.d:0 "A determined campaign by members of the administration in [Root.GetCapitalName] to oppose the changing of laws and regulations to accommodate integration of other systems into ours have successfully convinced the [Root.GetSenatorMP] from the area to oppose our proposition."
 parlaments.13.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.14.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.14.d:0 "The [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of [Root.GetName] have been convinced by those that hold interests in the production industries of the province to oppose opening the regulations that protect them from outside competition."
 parlaments.14.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.15.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.15.d:0 "Many in [Root.GetName] have been quite disappointed in the proposal to increase naval spending. They feel the area already contributes so much to the armed forces of our country and had rather expected the [Root.GetSenateParliment] to authorise more funds for them than ask for more money for the navy."
 parlaments.15.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.16.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.16.d:0 "The dominance of the navy in the province of [Root.GetName] has meant that the proposed increased spending on the army in [Root.GetCapSenateParliment] has been rather coldly received there. Despite initially having been positive to the proposition the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s from this area now see no choice but to vote against it."
 parlaments.16.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.17.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.17.d:0 "While initially in favour, the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s from [Root.GetName] have declared their disgust for the current issue. It signifies a far-reaching ambition of the state to own and control everything within its borders and they say they won't stand for it."
 parlaments.17.a:0 "You may very well think that. I couldn't comment."
 parlaments.18.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.18.d:0 "The [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of [Root.GetName] are surprisingly positive to our proposal in the [Root.GetSenatorialParlimentary] debate. It appears the university in [Root.GetName] is convinced it will be involved in the counting and measuring that the current proposal entails and scholars are delighted for the opportunity to take part of some new raw data regarding our country."
 parlaments.18.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.19.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.19.d:0 "Voting in favour of increasing taxes has been a very tough sell in [Root.GetName]. After numerous protests the [Root.GetSenatorMP] from the area has withdrawn his support for our proposition and is now opposing it fearing for his re-election."
 parlaments.19.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.20.t:0 "City Life"
 parlaments.20.d:0 "As representatives of areas that are sometimes quite distant from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] many [Root.GetSenatorMP]s often find that life in the capital during their visits is very different to what they are used to. Some find it both cramped and filthy and many seem quite relieved when they get to return home.\nThis year has proved even harder than usual to endure for the delicate sensibilities of our [Root.GetSenatorMP]s. The hot months have been unusually hot, the wet months unusually wet and the cold months unusually cold. A number of [Root.GetSenatorMP]s have now decided that they have had enough and have approached us asking to help make their stays more pleasant."
 parlaments.20.a:0 "We must do what we can."
 parlaments.20.b:0 "They'll have to endure like the rest of us."
 parlaments.21.t:0 "[Root.GetCapSenatorMP] in Scandal"
 parlaments.21.d:0 "A minor scandal has occurred in the capital during the current debate. It seems rather than attend the sessions himself, one of the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s was out disturbing the public peace and harassing his landlady. The outrage is great both among his peers and in the street and is likely to haunt future sessions for years."
 parlaments.21.a:0 "Let it slide."
 parlaments.21.b:0 "Arrest the [Root.GetSenatorMP]."
 parlaments.22.t:0 "Absenteeism"
 parlaments.22.d:0 "Given its great influence over the politics of our country it would be easy to assume that all [Root.GetSenatorMP]s attended [Root.GetSenatorialParlimentary] sessions with great enthusiasm, eager to do the most with the power they have been trusted with. This is, however, far from the case and in any given [Root.GetSenatorialParlimentary] session, there will be some that never show up, either because they are still enjoying their estates in the countryside or because they decide to partake in the many joys of the capital. The problem has grown more and more lately and we fear foreign dignitaries are laughing at us behind our backs. There are a number of measures that might be taken to increase attendance but none that the current [Root.GetSenatorMP]s would take very kindly too."
 parlaments.22.a:0 "Fine the worst excesses."
 parlaments.22.b:0 "There's nothing we can do."
 parlaments.23.t:0 "Demands for Representation"
 parlaments.23.d:0 "A number of hostile publications have begun to circulate in the cities of [Root.GetName]. Anonymous, yet very critical, authors claim that our the government is 'Autocratic' and demand both a written constitution and a [Root.GetSenateParliment] where the various parts of our country can be represented."
 parlaments.23.a:0 "Ban the Publications"
 parlaments.23.b:0 "Make vague promises of Reform"
 parlaments.24.t:0 "Financial Aid"
 parlaments.24.d:0 "Due to the current poor government finances any contribution to the state coffers is very welcome. It is therefore with some enthusiasm that we receive the representatives of a number of rich city assemblies offering to help. Their price, however, is greater representation in government in general and formalized ways for the state to ask for their help in the future."
 parlaments.24.a:0 "Grant them Greater Representation"
 parlaments.24.b:0 "Refuse their money."
 parlaments.24.c:0 "Promise to take their views in consideration."
 parlaments.24.dd:0 "Refuse their money."
 parlaments.25.t:0 "Demands of the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 parlaments.25.d:0 "While our country lacks a national [Root.GetSenateParliment], local assemblies exist since ancient times in many of our provinces. These have little influence outside of their own provinces but they will sometimes approach the state and their existence allows for a more efficient taxation of the provinces.\nLately trouble have been brewing in [Root.GetName] where a number of such provincial assemblies have recently begun to demand representation at a national level. They feel that they are poorly represented by the central government and that a central [Root.GetSenateParliment] where they could offer their opinions to the ruler would be the only way to alleviate this."
 parlaments.25.a:0 "We will think about it."
 parlaments.25.b:0 "Such ideas need to be crushed."
 parlaments.26.t:0 "Direct Contribution"
 parlaments.26.d:0 "Enthusiastic about the issue currently being debated in our [Root.GetSenateParliment], a group with their interest very much aligned to ours from [Root.GetName] have come to make a direct contribution to the state. It is their hope that the money can be put to good use to 'convince' any [Root.GetSenatorMP]s that are still opposed or at least compensate us for any such costs we have had up until now."
 parlaments.26.a:0 "I'm sure we will find a use for it."
 parlaments.27.t:0 "[Root.GetCapSenatorialParlimentary] Traditions"
 parlaments.27.d:0 "One of the more difficult things about being a parliamentarian has nothing to do with the debates in the capital but rather how to sell the new laws to the people back home. Still a local [Root.GetSenatorMP] will often have an easier time to explain a new tax than the collector sent by the central government would in less representative systems.\nIt seems the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s in general and the ones from [Root.GetName]in particular have become so adept at defending policies that we can see a rise in the support of the central government as a whole as a result."
 parlaments.27.a:0 "They finally understand me!"
 parlaments.28.t:0 "Support of Local Assembly"
 parlaments.28.d:0 "The local assembly in [Root.GetName] has been quite enthusiastic in their support of the proposition currently being debated in our [Root.GetSenateParliment]. So much so that they have already begun with the necessary preparations for what they are certain will be a certain approval."
 parlaments.28.a:0 "Remarkable."
 parlaments.29.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.29.d:0 "Citing their eternal loyalty to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] and their full confidence in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to know what is best for our state the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of the seat of [Root.GetName] have come out in support of our position in [Root.GetCapSenateParliment]. Their support for our cause is most welcome."
 parlaments.29.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.30.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.30.d:0 "Citing their mistrust of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to know what is best for our state the [Root.GetSenatorMP]s of the seat of [Root.GetName] have reversed their support of our position in [Root.GetCapSenateParliment]."
 parlaments.30.a:0 "Their lack of trust is disturbing."
