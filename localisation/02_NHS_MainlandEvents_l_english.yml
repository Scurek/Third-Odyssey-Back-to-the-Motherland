 nhs2_mainlandevents1.t:0 "Elysian return to Europe"
 nhs2_mainlandevents1.d:0 "We have made our triumphant return to Europe and reconquered Constantinople, the Queen of Cities. Already our supplies are being transported there, increasing our control over the local population."
 nhs2_mainlandevents1.a:0 "We must keep going!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents2.t:0 "The Elysian Menace"
 nhs2_mainlandevents2.d:0 "We have taken Constantinople from the Elysians, however, the reaction of the locals is mixed, with some saying that they actually enjoyed living under those barbarians!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents2.a:0 "Damn them!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents2.b:0 "Let them talk"
 nhs2_mainlandevents3.t:0 "The Great Explorer"
 nhs2_mainlandevents3.d:0 "The time has come for us to see what has become of our ancestors' homeland of Europe. To this end we have requested the service of a famous explorer named Pytheas, who, using both ancient maps from the Romans as well as scattered accounts from our flight, will lead an expedition of three small ships east and explore both the coastline and interior of Europe."
 nhs2_mainlandevents3.a:0 "We wish him luck"
 nhs2_mainlandevents4.t:0 "Europe Revealed"
 nhs2_mainlandevents4.d:0 "With the help of ancient sources, Pytheas has returned. After an uneventful voyage, in stark contrast to our previous attempt, he arrived off the coast of what our ancestors thought to be the end of the world, Ireland. After many months, Pytheas had gained knowledge of or visited firsthand the majority of a Europe that has changed greatly in our absence, and has caused quite a stir among the nobles of Europe. Now we must decide what position he should serve in our regime."
 nhs2_mainlandevents4.a:0 "Such deeds make him an ideal admiral"
 nhs2_mainlandevents4.b:0 "He would make a great advisor"
 nhs_unlock_invasion_decision_tt:0 "Unlocks §YBegin the Invasion Effort§! decision.\nUnlocks §YAbandon Hellenic Heritage§! decision."
 
 nhs2_mainlandevents5.t:0 "Secret Sharing"
 nhs2_mainlandevents5.d:0 "We had heard rumours that the great explorer Pytheas was recruited by the Elysians, and then he suddenly went missing. With his widely publicised return from Europe this rumour has been confirmed. Though we are unhappy that they kept the expedition a secret from us, the fact that the Elysians are sharing what they have learned with us counts for something, right?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents5.a:0 "So that's how it looks, eh?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents.28.t:0 "Western Lands"
 nhs2_mainlandevents.28.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have auspicious news: the Greeks, long thought dead or lost, have resurfaced on an unknown continent to the west! An explorer and envoy named Pytheas has sailed east on a ship of older Iberian design, but which unmistakably flies the double-headed eagle of the Greeks. Whatever our feelings toward their deception, one thing is clear: there is land in the west, even if we have to pry it from a resurgent Greek empire."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.28.a:0 "Fortune awaits across the sunset!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents.29.t:0 "Our Ancient Brethren"
 nhs2_mainlandevents.29.d:0 "Generations ago, our forefathers were last seen sailing west on a grand fleet and were never seen again. We all thought they had died, but they have returned from the lands across the ocean. Their envoy speaks of a verdant green land filled with untapped potential that they have built into a second Roman Empire. They have sailed here to scout Europe, hopefully in preparation for a grand invasion to repel the invaders who pillage our heartlands."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.29.a:0 "The long siege is almost over. Forward, Romans!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents.31.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 nhs2_mainlandevents.31.d:0 "We thought we had subdued and conquered the Romans. We were wrong. An envoy sailing in from beyond the edge of the world has bragged to our foes and allies alike about a great host assembling in a land called Elysium. The intent is clear: the Romans, once defeated, have risen like a phoenix to challenge us again. They will march east from paradise to invade our homes, and we must be ready."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.31.a:0 "It will be the greatest conflict of our age."
 nhs2_mainlandevents6.t:0 "Gaining a foothold"
 nhs2_mainlandevents6.d:0 "Our military elites now know all the secrets of the European fire-powder and are currently introducing it into our armies and navies. With their technological advantage negated, we are now able to seriously consider a large scale invasion of the continent across the sea, specifically our ancestor's homeland of Hellas. How should we go about it?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents6.a:0 "We must secure our supply lines first!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents6.b:0 "Invade the motherland straight away!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents6.c:0 "We are not ready for such a crazy plan yet!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents7.t:0 "Supply Lines"
 nhs2_mainlandevents7.d:0 "We have chosen to secure our supply lines, and your military advisors have shown you several regions which should be relatively undefended but will also act as a stepping stone for our invasion.\n\n   IMPORTANT: Claims will be removed after you conquer one of the required provinces"
 nhs2_mainlandevents7.a:0 "Invade the Western Mediterranean Isles!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents7.b:0 "Invade the Eastern Mediterranean Isles!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents7.c:0 "Invade the North African ports!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents7.e:0 "Invade the West African coast and surrounding islands!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents7.f:0 "We are not ready yet"
 nhs2_mainlandevents8.t:0 "Supply Lines Secured"
 nhs2_mainlandevents8.d:0 "With our supply lines secured, the Elysian supply ships are in position to keep our men supplied with ammo and food for the coming invasion of Greece"
 nhs2_mainlandevents8.a:0 "It pays to be prepared"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.t:0 "Invasion of Hellas"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.d:0 "Whether our supply lines are secured or not, our nation is ready to undertake what will be our greatest challenge since our flight from Europe all those decades ago! Where should we establish our base of operations?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.a:0 "In Athens, the home of the philosophers"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.b:0 "In Macedonia, birthplace of Alexander the Great"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.c:0 "In Sparta, homeland of the warriors"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.e:0 "In Rhodes, with its strong defences"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.f:0 "We are not ready yet"
 nhs2_mainlandevents9.m:0 "We are not ready yet"
 nhs_supply_linest4:0 "There are some provinces in the region which we could still colonise"
 nhs2_mainlandevents10.t:0 "Elysians request our land!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents10.d:0 "The Elysian fleet that is massing off our coast is requesting permission to set up their base of operations in one of our provinces, though we are not in any position to argue otherwise."
 nhs2_mainlandevents10.a:0 "We can't stop them anyway"
 nhs2_mainlandevents10.b:0 "You aren't Hellenic any more!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents11.t:0 "The Hellenes accept our terms"
 nhs2_mainlandevents11.d:0 "The Hellenes have surrendered their land without a fight, and are in awe of our ways. They hope to be a part of our resurgent Hellenic empire, even if we act a little differently to them."
 nhs2_mainlandevents11.a:0 "We accept them with open arms!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents12.t:0 "The Hellenes refuse our terms"
 nhs2_mainlandevents12.d:0 "The local Hellenes have refused our terms, citing the fact that we abandoned our Hellenic ways, and therefore are not worthy of their respect"
 nhs2_mainlandevents12.a:0 "Then they will respect force!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents13.t:0 "Base of operations secured"
 nhs2_mainlandevents13.d:0 "We have seized a city that held great significance to our ancestor Hellenes, places that many Elysians believed to be myths until now, and as a result, our men will fight with renewed vigour."
 nhs2_mainlandevents13.a:0 "Fight on!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents14.t:0 "Conquest of Constantinople"
 nhs2_mainlandevents14.d:0 "The banners wave from on high, atop the ruined walls. The Theodosian Walls were once the grandest in the world, but our foe, decadent and fat, has allowed them to fall into decay. They now lie in ruins, shattered under the weight of our cannons. Ancient pagan temples, Christian shrines, sacred and profane monuments alike have burned under the strength of our hellfire, and our fury overcame the flagging spirit of the defenders. Regardless of the cost, we have finally retaken the city of Constantine, the 'City of the World's Desire', and our people rejoice. Though it may no longer be as grand or relative to our empire as our western holdings, it is the tremendous significance of this victory that matters to our people. We are home."
 nhs2_mainlandevents14.a:0 "Roman splendour triumphs once again."
 nhs2_mainlandevents14.b:0 "It is not to our strategic advantage"
 nhs2_mainlandevents15.t:0 "Constantinople lost!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents15.d:0 "Our capital, the great 'City of the World's Desire' has been lost to foreign invaders, calling themselves the descendants of Romans that once lived here. Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to escape the city without serious injuries but his most of his personal guard perished protecting him. This will unfortunately serve as a big setback in this war and surely turn the tables in invader's favour."
 nhs2_mainlandevents15.a:0 "How could this be?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents16.t:0 "Constantinople lost!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents16.d:0 "Constantinople, the great 'City of the World's Desire' has today fallen to foreign invaders, calling themselves the descendants of Romans that once lived here. While this may not be a big setback to us it will serve as encouragement to invader's troops."
 nhs2_mainlandevents16.a:0 "It was just bad luck, that's all"
 nhs2_mainlandevents17.t:0 "Constantinople back in our hands!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents17.d:0 "Constantinople, the great 'City of the World's Desire' has been retaken and our administration is already preparing to officially move our capital there."
 nhs2_mainlandevents17.a:0 "Rejoice!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents18.t:0 "Constantinople lost!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents18.d:0 "Sadly, Constantinople has been once again lost to Turks, which is not only a loss for us but the city also suffered in retaking. We must now prepare to take it again before it gets back under barbaric Turkish influence again."
 nhs2_mainlandevents18.a:0 "Will there be anything left?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents19.t:0 "A Hellenic militia?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents19.d:0 "As we continue our liberation of our ancestor land, we seem to have trouble with overseas administration there. Hellenes that are willing to fight for our cause have trouble enlisting in army and taxes seem to be getting lost somewhere between the people and our treasury. So one of our advisors backed by the so called 'Hellenic war-council' proposed the idea of forming local Hellenic militia under the partially autonomous leadership of a local noble, who will make sure that all able Hellenes join the fight and pay us part of his tax on monthly basis. The solution is only temporary, but will last for the duration of this invasion."
 nhs2_mainlandevents19.a:0 "A splendid idea"
 nhs2_mainlandevents19.b:0 "This won't do"
 nhs2_mainlandevents20.t:0 "The fate of Konstantinia"
 nhs2_mainlandevents20.d:0 "Our invasion of Europe is over for now, and we now must answer the question of what to do with our Hellenic sub state. The nobles of Constantina are requesting that we give them complete control over Hellenic territory, something many Elysians back home are nervous about doing, but doing this would strengthen our defences in Europe. Alternatively, we could establish a less independant vassal state, which would benefit our treasury, but weaken our military presence in Europe."
 nhs2_mainlandevents20.a:0 "Give them what they want"
 nhs2_mainlandevents20.b:0 "Vassal state it is!"
 nhs2_mainlandevents20.c:0 "We have no need of them any more"
 nhs2_mainlandevents21.t:0 "Question of religion"
 nhs2_mainlandevents21.d:0 "With our Hellenic sub state, Konstantinia, officially established, we must now decide their religious affinity. Should they remain Christian as they are now or should we enlighten them and teach them about the old ways?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents21.a:0 "It is our duty to enlighten them in the ways of their ancestors"
 nhs2_mainlandevents21.b:0 "It's no use, they have already fallen too far"
 nhs2_mainlandevents25.t:0 "Orthodox Populace"
 nhs2_mainlandevents25.d:0 "Missionaries have been sent to one of our newly acquired provinces. Let's pray to Zeus that they are successful."
 nhs2_mainlandevents25.a:0 "May the Athena guide them"
 nhs2_mainlandevents22.t:0 "Delegation of Hellas?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents22.d:0 "With Hellas now under our control, we could set up a local government due to our inability controlling it directly, creating a sub state named after a famous Eastern Roman Emperor, Constantine. This would allow us to focus on other matters, and they would be a useful ally for any further expansion into Europe. There, as usual, are those against the bill insist that any subject we create will turn on us eventually..."
 nhs2_mainlandevents22.a:0 "We don't really have a choice, do we?"
 nhs2_mainlandevents22.b:0 "Try establishing a less independent vassal state."
 nhs2_mainlandevents22.c:0 "We should listen to the council of those wise man and take direct control of the land"
 nhs2_mainlandevents23.t:0 "[Root.GetName]"
 nhs2_mainlandevents23.d:0 "We have recently retook [Root.GetName] from our enemies and we must now decide what to do with it."
 nhs2_mainlandevents23.a:0 "Cede it to Konstantinia as we promised"
 nhs2_mainlandevents23.b:0 "We must use it to strengthen our militia"
 nhs2_mainlandevents23.c:0 "It is not to our strategic advantage"
 nhs2_mainlandevents24.t:0 "Invasion of Hellas Complete"
 nhs2_mainlandevents24.d:0 "After many hard-fought battles and long sieges, our invasion of Hellas is complete! We have forever changed how the rest of the world sees us: no longer do the Europeans see us as primitive exiles from across the sea, but a world power in our own right. Whether this is the start of a long conflict with the East is yet to be seen."
 nhs2_mainlandevents24.a:0 "But for now, let's rejoice!"
 nhs_supply_claimst:0 "We lose claims on Supply Lines target provinces"
 nhs2_mainlandevents50.t:0 "Province Acquired"

 nhs2_mainlandevents.27.d:0 "Now that we have retaken [151.GetName], we have had the opportunity to properly uncover and explore the old Imperial Library - including hidden sections that our enemies never quite managed to reach. Most of it consists of knowledge we already have, or that is outdated, but some key things stand out to our scholars. Ancient texts on philosophy, rhetoric, and law; methods of dye and silk production as well as a list of favorable climates and organisms with which to manufacture it; and even an original manuscript on the production of Greek Fire dating from the eighth century. Some of this knowledge is redundant, but on the whole, it's a fantastic windfall."

 nhs2_mainlandevents.32.d:0 "Our cousins to the west have grown mighty, strong enough to reclaim the mantle of Rome, and now they wish to prove their prestige beyond all doubt. A diplomatic delegation has arrived from Elysia requesting that we cede control of the City of the World's Desire to them."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.32.a:0 "They will be able to protect it easier than us."

Much work remains to be done, but the most important step has been achieved without bloodshed. The circle is now complete. We sailed west and now we have returned to our homeland in the east."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.33.a:0 "Forward, sons and daughters of Elysia!"
 
 nhs2_mainlandevents.34.t:0 "Our Claims Rejected"
 nhs2_mainlandevents.34.d:0 "Our foolish cousins in Europe have rejected that we, descendants of the Romans, are the rightful stewards of Konstantinoupolis. Our good relations, our might, and our superior claim are not enough, it seems, for our cousins to recognize us as the true sovereigns of the Queen of Cities."
 nhs2_mainlandevents.34.a:0 "It seems there must be war after all..."
