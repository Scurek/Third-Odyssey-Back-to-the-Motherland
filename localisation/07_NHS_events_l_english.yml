 nhs2_albania.1.t:0 "The Albanian Question"
 nhs2_albania.1.da:0 "We've been in this land for some time now, and we’ve set up outposts and fortresses along the breadth of the bay we landed at. Now, Skanderbeg is requesting that his people be allowed to settle on the frontier of our newly-claimed territory. Indeed, tensions are slowly mounting between the Romans and the Albanians, and it would be prudent to allow them to leave. The only question that remains is where to settle them."
 nhs2_albania.1.db:0 "We've been in this land for some time now, and we’ve set up outposts and fortresses along the breadth of the bay we landed at. Now, Skanderbeg, who has retired from leading our troops due to a grievous wound, from which many thought he would never recover, is requesting that his people be allowed to settle on the frontier of our newly-claimed territory. Indeed, tensions are slowly mounting between the Romans and the Albanians, and it would be prudent to allow them to leave. The only question that remains is where to settle them."
 nhs2_albania.1.dc:0 "We've been in this land for some time now, and we’ve set up outposts and fortresses along the breadth of the bay we landed at. Now, Gjon, son of the great Albanian hero Skandenberg, who led his people alongside ours into this new world, is requesting that his people be allowed to settle on the frontier of our newly-claimed territory. Indeed, tensions are slowly mounting between the Romans and the Albanians, and it would be prudent to allow them to leave. The only question that remains is where to settle them."
 nhs2_albania.1.dd:0 "We've been in this land for some time now, and we’ve set up outposts and fortresses along the breadth of the bay we landed at. Now, [Root.oth_alb_ruler.GetName], descendant of the great Albanian hero Skandenberg, who led his people alongside ours into this new world, is requesting that his people be allowed to settle on the frontier of our newly-claimed territory. Indeed, tensions are slowly mounting between the Romans and the Albanians, and it would be prudent to allow them to leave. The only question that remains is where to settle them."
 nhs2_albania.1.a:0 "Settle them at a good harbor, close to the capitol."
 nhs2_albania.1.b:0 "Settle them on the frontier, deeper into native lands."
 nhs2_albania.1.c:0 "Send them south to find their own destiny."
 nhs2_albania.1.e:0 "Supply them and send them south"
 nhs2_albania.2.t:0 "Albanian Revolt"
 nhs2_albania.2.d:0 "It seems that the next generation of Albanians are not as indebted to us as their forefathers were. Though many Elysians were initially grateful for the additional manpower that the Albanians provided, they were never integrated into our society as easily as the natives were, and as a result they have become increasingly isolated. Many cities with an Albanian majority are protesting our recent policies, claiming that we are treating them as second class citizens. Riots are beginning to break out, and already there have been retaliation attacks from angry guards and civilians on both sides of the conflict. To make matters worse, local nobles have gathered their troops, and every Albanian settlement might as well be a castle. The Albanians are not out to defeat us, they just want to avoid losing. How should we handle this?"
 nhs2_albania.2.a:0 "I guess we can accommodate them more"
 nhs2_albania.2.b:0 "Give them special privileges"
 nhs2_albania.2.c:0 "We will crush these separatists!"

 nhs2_albania.3.t:0 "Culture Change Failed"
 nhs2_albania.3.d:0 "Our attempts to remove the Albanians from this province has failed. They ignore our orders to leave their homes and even if they do, they just turn around and go back. They simply refuse to budge."
 nhs2_albania.3.a:0 "Well this is awkward..."
 nhs2_albania.4.t:0 "Treaty of the False King"
 nhs2_albania.4.d:0 "After a long and bloody war, we have begrudgingly granted Albanian separatists their independence. They have established their own nation of Shqiperi, and are administered as an absolute monarchy ruled by a king. We have signed what we have called the 'Treaty of the False King', a name that irks them and delights our ambassadors to no end. It states that we will respect each others borders for a period of 100 years; what will happen after it expires remains to be seen."
 nhs2_albania.4.a:0 "I don't think I'll live to see it"
 nhs2_albania.5.t:0 "War of Independence lost"
 nhs2_albania.5.d:0 "Our armies have taken the last remaining stronghold of the Albanians. Regardless of how long it has taken us, we have now shown that we are not to be trifled with, and it is unlikely that the Albanians will attempt anything like this again."
 nhs2_albania.5.a:0 "We can only hope"
 nhs2_albania.2.tooltip2:0 "A treaty will be signed, guaranteeing their independence for 100 years."
 nhs2_albania.6.t:0 "Treaty of the False King"
 nhs2_albania.6.d:0 "The Treaty of the False King is still in place, guaranteeing Albanian independence."
 nhs2_albania.6.a:0 "We must respect the treaty!"
 nhs2_albania.8.t:0 "Albanians Expand Into New Lands"
 nhs2_albania.8.d:0 "The Albanian populace has expanded their zone of control to include another province. The province was previously empty, so no harm was done to our nation. The natives do not complain either; the Albanians simply settle, fortify, and isolate themselves as much as possible keeping into account the lands used by the natives. They breed like rabbits, but then again, so do we, as we all must in this savage New World."
 nhs2_albania.8.a:0 "They always just do as they please."
 nhs_albanians_south_tooltip:0 "They will try to establish their own nation."
