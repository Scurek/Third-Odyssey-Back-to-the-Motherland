 BOOKMARK_FLIGHT_OF_THE_BYZANTINES:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 BOOKMARK_FLIGHT_OF_THE_BYZANTINES_DESC:0 "Experience an alternate history, where the Emperor of Byzantium ponders the state of the realm. Gradually his appreciation for the works written about the fall of Troy and the adventures of its heroes increases and it inspires him to consider a bold move. Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey faced hardships on his way back home. Aeneas in Vergil's Aeneid was forced to flee the city and was led by Jupiter and Venus to found the city Lavinium after a great Odyssey of his own. This city would later be known as the city from which Romulus and Remus's mother originated. Now it is time for the Byzantines to embark on the Third Odyssey... will you lead the faltering Greeks to a New World?"

 BOOKMARK_RISE_OF_ELYSIA:0 "Rise of Elysia"
 BOOKMARK_RISE_OF_ELYSIA_DESC:0 "The Third Odyssey is now well underway, with the Elysians enduring many hardships in their quest to establish themselves in the vast continent of Elysium. However, their troubles are not over yet. With refugees from the nation of Shqiperi settling inside their lands, the splinter nation of Spartakon establishing themselves in the southern jungles, and the newly discovered and mysterious Vikings menacing from the north, could this be the end for the Elysians, or will they rise and become the greatest empire the world has ever known?"
 
 THIRD_ODYSSEY_MP:0 "The Arrival"
 THIRD_ODYSSEY_MP_DESC:0 "While the journey across the ocean is over, the Third Odyssey has just begun. Now stranded in an unknown land, the Byzantine exiles had made sacrifices of their territory and integrity and lost many men and women to the perils of the Atlantic. Tough decisions have been made, ones which will surely haunt them in the future. But now, a whole world of opportunity awaits. The Promised Land of Elysium stands before them - will the people of Nea Konstantinoupolis be strong, witty, and resourceful enough to take it?"

 nhs2_bookmark.1.t:0 "Elysian Expansion"
 nhs2_bookmark.1.d:0 "As the Elysian frontier moves further inland, many of the Barbaroi tribes are banding together for mutual defence, with the most recent of these federations calling themselves the \"Haudenosaunee\" or Iroquois. Seeking an ally amongst the natives, the Emperor married his youngest daughter to the Iroquoian Chief, known as Theyanoguin. Though the alliance remains stable for now, the Elysian conversion of Theyanoguin and several high-ranking Iroquois Chieftains has angered many Barbaroi who feel that their leaders are abandoning the ways of their ancestors. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of the Kykladian Islands to the south provides Elysia s merchants with exiting new trade opportunities. Establishing trade outposts in the region will help strengthen trade and communication networks with the Spartans while also allowing the Emperor to keep an eye on them. The Albanians remain a minority within our realm and are content to isolate themselves within fortified settlements, though how long this will last remains to be seen. Finally, the Viking colonies of Markland and Helluland have united under a single banner to form the nation of Vinland. With their combined strength, the Norsemen now pose a threat to Elysian trade and dominance of the sea, unless they can be persuaded otherwise..."

 nhs2_bookmark.2.t:0 "The War of the Jaguar"
 nhs2_bookmark.2.d:0 "In the years since their initial landing, the Spartans have managed to create a small but powerful kingdom situated along the coast of Lakonya. Leonidas, self-styled "King of the Spartans" and younger brother to the Elysian Emperor, is hoping to expand further inland to secure his position. A coalition of native empires led by the Aztecs, known as the \"Jaguar League\" , have put aside their past differences and declared war on the expanding Spartakon nation in the hopes of ridding their lands of the warmongering foreigners once and for all. Even now the armies of the Jaguar League march in great numbers towards the outnumbered but fierce Spartan legions."

 nhs2_bookmark.3.d:0 "After being separated from their Byzantine brethren in the 'Great Storm', the Kretans found themselves stranded on a small island they named Lanthanon Nisi or 'Lost Island'. The remaining survivors live off a meagre diet of fish and whatever supplies they salvaged from the wreckage, but will not last long. Luckily, Kretan watchmen have spotted a small fleet of ships approaching on the horizon, though whether they bring salvation or destruction is unknown..."

 nhs2_bookmark.4.t:0 "Vikings of Vinland"
 nhs2_bookmark.4.d:0 "After engaging in centuries of petty but ultimately indecisive conflict, the 'lost' Viking colonies of Helluland and Markland have united under a single banner, though at the cost of countless Viking warriors and nobles on both sides. To ensure that such a conflict never occurs again, the Jarls have agreed to return to the governing assemblies of their ancestors, the Althing, thereby allowing all Norse freemen to solve their differences through words rather than conflict. With the civil war now behind them, the Vikings of Vinland are free to focus on expanding further into Skraeling territory, or maybe even raid Elysian shipping?"

 nhs2_bookmark.5.d:0 "It was as we had been blessed. The preparations had only just begun, and sudden wave of excitement started spreading around the high court like a wildfire. Hidden in a cache separate from the one detailing how to construct truly ocean-worthy vessels rested a number of manuscripts detailing the construction of siphons and the long-lost formula for Greek Fire, the weapon that saved the Roman Empire on multiple occasions. We could have ordered our alchemists to resume the production of the Liquid Fire and order our smiths to construct siphons we can fit on naval vessels, but every person working on that was one less person aiding in retrofitting our fleet into ocean-going designs."

Their leader stated that one of the ships and accompanying supplies can be used by us on our travels if we agreed to share our discoveries with them. They were under the impression we are heading south to explore the coasts of Africa. One of our advisors suggested that we use this opportunity to trick the nations of Europe, making them believe that we were caught up in a series of increasingly treacherous storms filled with sea monsters and that our last act was to inform them. That way, it might take some generations before their curiosity returns. Alternatively, we could have informed the Portuguese of our true intentions, providing us with a potential future ally in Europe."

A very charismatic man, capable of inspiring men in the face of death, and he served us well in the armies fighting against the Ottomans. So it seems strange that he of all men would suggest such a thing: return to worshipping the Old Gods, the Roman and Hellenic Gods. He said he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he stated that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon. If there are Gods, he continued, they must be as flawed and ill-tempered as the old Hellenic Gods. We would do best to appease them, rather than speak to a God that may listen, but seems not to care."
