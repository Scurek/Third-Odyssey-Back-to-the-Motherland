1.20.17 BETA 1 Changelog:
CONFEDERATION AND NATIVE BALANCE:
-Added more factors that control confederation formation and tweaked existing ones, which should result in federations much less likely to form, especially if the countries do not share a culture or are not under any threat. Some of the new factors include: Strong allies, relative strength, trust and diplomatic reputation
-Confederation will can now only centralize/integrate members that are connected to its capital
-Reworked Consensus Government and Law of Peace so they don't prevent declaring wars most of the time. Basically native nations will no longer be ruled by abstract native councils as this caused bugs.
-Halved initial government reform progress for natives. This will result in them colonising later, especially if they are isolated.
-Somewhat lowered the starting development of North American tribes
-Shawnee now start under a single tag, located in the Ohio proper
-Osage have migrated west to the Osage river and now start allied with Cahokia. The country and the culture has been renamed to Hoga, to reflect that the cultural split did not occur yet.
-Miami tag has been one province to the north, still within Miami lands
