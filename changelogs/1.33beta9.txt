1.33 BETA9 hotfix 3 Changelog:
IMPROVEMENTS AND BALANCE
-Added a new opening theme by Utopia
-Spartan tier 2 units now use gun
+Replaced autonomy gain in Cultural Sufferance with 10 minimum autonomy
--This was done since increasing the autonomy right after the colony is completed also set the "hidden" autonomy to that number. In other words colonies start with 50 autonomy if they are in a state and it drops to 0 immediately after they are cored. With the privilege they instead got 70% autonomy which didn't drop once cored, thus the effective increase used to be 70% not 20%.

BUGFIXES
-Fixed shield walk animation
-Reenabled greek fire animations
-Fixed missing current faction attitude tooltip on Elysian Religious Wars


1.33 BETA9 hotfix 2 Changelog:
IMPROVEMENTS AND BALANCE
+Attempted to rebalance the greek fire modifiers
--Second version of the Greek Fire modifier now adds 10% ICA instead of 5%
--Reduced maintenance penalties across all greek fire reforms
--Greek fire reforms now increase infantry fire instead of ICA and fire damage
--If greek fire is acquired later, it will now require an investment of mil power and cash to actually get the modifier.
--If greek fire is acquired later, it will no longer provide baseline infantry combat ability.
