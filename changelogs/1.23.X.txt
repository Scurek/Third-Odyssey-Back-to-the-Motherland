MONUMENT CHANGES:
-Standardised the cost and build time of Elysian monuments.

-Rewrote the event texts for the initial events for those three monuments.
-Instead of initial requirements based on monarch power and advisors, the monuments now have new requirements spread among the individual tiers.
-Hippodrome at Tier III now has a "Hold Triumph" mechanic, which gives both peace and wartime boosts as your glory accumulates via winning battles.

-Cothon at Tier II now has a "Trade Expedition" mechanic, which allows you to get diplomatic, trade and production bonuses in a trade node.
-Moved Great Project window to the right of the building menu and made it large enough to show two great projects. Sadly the window size cannot be made dynamic.

EXARCH CHANGES:
