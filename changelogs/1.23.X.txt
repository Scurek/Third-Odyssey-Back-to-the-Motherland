1.23.1 Changelog:

1.23.0 Changelog:
FEATURES:
-Elysian Silk Production objectives, a new custom UI based mechanic, that allows you to gradually expand the production of Elysian Silk if you had taken it with you initially.

CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
-Updated the mod to 1.36.1
-Standardize Currency mission now lets you choose the target province, plus it gives some extra benefits to that province
-Renamed Kreta Minor to Kauda. Rewrote the events regarding Kaudan vassalization, added a new variant of the event if you are tolerant Hellenic and added a couple of accompanying events if you forcibly convert Kauda but you promised not to
-Choosing the target province for Akrotirion and Elysian Highway Network is now done via buttons in the province menu, since previous system was buggy due to how pdx designed the monuments
-Exarchs will no longer be part of the HRE if they are created on its lands. Exarch provinces can now be removed from HRE
-Janissary reserve now scales from 0 to 10000 instead of 0 to 10, essentially all the increases and costs got multiplied by 1000, so it now functions more like manpower numerically. In my opinion it's more readable now, but feel free to comment if you prefer the old scales. This was the original design but in 1.35 you progress bar didn't work if the max value was >100.
-Orhan Celeby as a general now has a siege specialist trait
-Johannes Grandt and Orhan Celebi now have historical birth dates as advisors
-A New World to Explore modifier is now removed by taking the A New Start idea, instead of a few days after, since ideas can now have effects upon taking them. In the past this wasn't possible since effects couldn't be tied to you taking an idea.
-Improved the localisation of the "Northern Warriors Offer Services" event (now simply called "Varangian Warriors")
-Added a list of Patreon supporters to the main menu
-Exarchs now get a free core on their capital only, instead of the entire capital area
