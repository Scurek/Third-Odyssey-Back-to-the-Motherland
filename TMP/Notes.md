# Notes

- Mission tree: can it be reorganised to more clearly seperate 'Elysian' and standard missions?
- Sacrifice to gods: option 2 (gain 5 prestige) should be lose 5 prestige
- Reform the military description: Skirmishes with neighboring tribes - thankfully not that frequent - have laid bare the problems our military structure faces. Many of the soldiers we brought with us, must now toil in the fields whenever possible. Only a handful of royal bodyguards can truly be considered a professional force. Furthermore, our army structure and strategies are ill-suited to the challenges we face. A strong militia is required to fend off raids and skirmishes. If we are to survive in this foreign land, we must learn its ways.
    * Enlist Barbaroi: expand service duty to the Barbaroi that join our settlements. -> Higher manpower, manpower recovery
    * Soften Militia criteria: expand the service duty to larger parts of our non-Barbaroi population. -> Higher morale, lower production
- Seals trade good looks like Corn
- SKoros silk trade good looks like coal... probably a shift in the trade goods somewhere?
- Custom estates base loyalty is too low (30% instead of 50%). Probably carry over from old estate system.
- Dynatoi upset about low legitimacy... but Elysia has no legitimacy???
- In fact Elysia doesn't seem to be a real monarchy. No heir. Probably need to make that explicit in 'Exiled empire' government reform?
- Governing capacity increase for 'Exiled Empire' should be 50% reduction instead.
- Can't use any crownland buttons, despite meeting conditions? Seems to unlock once all estates are active.
- Government reforms:
    - Curtail <> Strengthen noble privileges could be Barbaroi officials <> Noble offices (encourage employment of Barbaroi as officials, versus ensure important offices can only be hold by Elysian nobility)
- Government reforms seem to be bugged, I could select both curtail and strengthen noble privileges :/
- Manufactory and coastal defense building images missing
- Rename Ohio trade node to Great lakes? Though Elysians might be more imaginative in naming... the natives seem to call them great lakes in their own language, probably for lack of knowing other great lakes. Or maybe the Norse, living there longer, already have a name for it the Elysians adopted? 'The tamed seas' springs to mind.
- Gift from local chieftain: Do away with needless 'men writing women' stuff
- Should get better description for 'Emigration' province modifier. Elysia isn't suddenly a metropolis.
- Hieretiai available event: there should be a better text for the only option?
- Albanian vassal gets new land: culture is shqiproi but religion is totemist... I did force-convert the vassal from orthodox to hellenic, if that matters.
- Albanian vassal: new lands get albanian majority modifier, but not albanian rule modifier. Maybe make the modifier active/inactive based on owner culture instead of adding modifier that undoes it? That means losing defensiveness, but that could be split in separate 'Albanian fortifications' modifier which can remain even if 'Albanian majority' is removed through senate.
- Maybe introduce 'fisher fleet' modifier instead of granting ships when the colony ships are restored in landing event? No one in their right mind would take the ships, but using them for phishing may increase production, manpower, and alleviate naval penalties.
- Make draft militia decision invisible after use (it's already permanently disabled).
- Rename 'A new world to explore' to 'Elysium enthousiasm'
- Powhattan bought province still has seperatism after purchase.
- Hera pantheon is incredibly weak
- Can we delay canons in Elysian and native tech groups? Or otherwise provide debuff. Artillery shouldn't be so much cheaper than horses.
- Better name for 'Seagate toll'?
- Somehow, fleet maintenance is so negative I'm receiving money! (only have that flagship, which also has high maintenance reduction)
- I don't think 'Explore the new world' is used by anyone. If this is the only reason to keep some provinces out of colonial zones, maybe undo?
- Make noble cataphracts timed
- Event informing for Alexandrian library decision
- Player should be informed that herald diplomatic decisions are available, remove old decisions
